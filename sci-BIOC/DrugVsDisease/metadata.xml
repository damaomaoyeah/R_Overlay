		Comparison of disease and drug profiles using Gene set Enrichment
		Analysis // This package generates ranked lists of differential
		gene expression for either disease or drug profiles. Input data
		can be downloaded from Array Express or GEO, or from local CEL
		files. Ranked lists of differential expression and associated
		p-values are calculated using Limma. Enrichment scores
		(Subramanian et al. PNAS 2005) are calculated to a reference
		set of default drug or disease profiles, or a set of custom
		data supplied by the user. Network visualisation of significant
		scores are output in Cytoscape format.
