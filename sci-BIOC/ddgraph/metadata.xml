		Distinguish direct and indirect interactions with Graphical
		Modelling // Distinguish direct from indirect interactions in
		gene regulation and infer combinatorial code from highly
		correlated variables such as transcription factor binding
		profiles. The package implements the Neighbourhood Consistent
		PC algorithm (NCPC) and draws Direct Dependence Graphs to
		represent dependence structure around a target variable. The
		package also provides a unified interface to other Graphical
		Modelling (Bayesian Network) packages for distinguishing direct
		and indirect interactions.
