		GEOsearch // GEOsearch is an extendable search engine for NCBI
		GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus). Instead of directly searching
		the term, GEOsearch can find all the gene names contained in
		the search term and search all the alias of the gene names
		simultaneously in GEO database. GEOsearch also provides other
		functions such as summarizing common biology keywords in the
		search results.
