		Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets // Coordinated Gene
		Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS) implements a Bayesian MCMC
		matrix factorization algorithm, GAPS, and links it to gene set
		statistic methods to infer biological process activity.  It can
		be used to perform sparse matrix factorization on any data, and
		when this data represents biomolecules, to do gene set
		analysis.
