		Summary, annotation and visualization of genomic data // A
		package for summary and annotation of genomic intervals. Users
		can visualize and quantify genomic intervals over pre-defined
		functional regions, such as promoters, exons, introns, etc. The
		genomic intervals represent regions with a defined chromosome
		position, which may be associated with a score, such as aligned
		reads from HT-seq experiments, TF binding sites, methylation
		scores, etc. The package can use any tabular genomic feature
		data as long as it has minimal information on the locations of
		genomic intervals. In addition, It can use BAM or BigWig files
		as input.
