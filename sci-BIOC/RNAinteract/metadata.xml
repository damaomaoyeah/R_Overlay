		Estimate Pairwise Interactions from multidimensional features //
		RNAinteract estimates genetic interactions from multi-
		dimensional read-outs like features extracted from images. The
		screen is assumed to be performed in multi-well plates or
		similar designs. Starting from a list of features (e.g. cell
		number, area, fluorescence intensity) per well, genetic
		interactions are estimated. The packages provides functions for
		reporting interacting gene pairs, plotting heatmaps and double
		RNAi plots. An HTML report can be written for quality control
		and analysis.
