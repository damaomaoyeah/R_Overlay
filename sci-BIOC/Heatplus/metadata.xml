		Heatmaps with row and/or column covariates and colored clusters
		// Display a rectangular heatmap (intensity plot) of a data
		matrix. By default, both samples (columns) and features (row)
		of the matrix are sorted according to a hierarchical
		clustering, and the corresponding dendrogram is plotted.
		Optionally, panels with additional information about samples
		and features can be added to the plot.
