		Quality Assessment Tools for Oxford Nanopore MinION data //
		IONiseR provides tools for the quality assessment of Oxford
		Nanopore MinION data. It extracts summary statistics from a set
		of fast5 files and can be used either before or after base
		calling.  In addition to standard summaries of the read-types
		produced, it provides a number of plots for visualising metrics
		relative to experiment run time or spatially over the surface
		of a flowcell.
