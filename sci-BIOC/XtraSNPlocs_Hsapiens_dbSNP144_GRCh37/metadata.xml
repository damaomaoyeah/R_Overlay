		Extra SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 144) // Extra
		SNP locations and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI
		dbSNP Build 144. The source data files used for this package
		were created by NCBI on May 29-30, 2015, and contain SNPs
		mapped to reference genome GRCh37.p13 (a patched version of
		GRCh37 that doesn't alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT). While
		the SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP144.GRCh37 package contains only
		molecular variations of class "snp", this package contains
		molecular variations of other classes (in-del, heterozygous,
		microsatellite, named-locus, no-variation, mixed, and
		multinucleotide-polymorphism).
