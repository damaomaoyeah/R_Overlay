		Utilities to create and use an Ensembl based annotation database
		// The package provides functions to create and use transcript
		centric annotation databases/packages. The annotation for the
		databases are directly fetched from Ensembl using their Perl
		API. The functionality and data is similar to that of the TxDb
		packages from the GenomicFeatures package, but, in addition to
		retrieve all gene/transcript models and annotations from the
		database, the ensembldb package provides also a filter
		framework allowing to retrieve annotations for specific entries
		like genes encoded on a chromosome region or transcript models
		of lincRNA genes.
