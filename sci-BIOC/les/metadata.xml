		Identifying Differential Effects in Tiling Microarray Data // The
		'les' package estimates Loci of Enhanced Significance (LES) in
		tiling microarray data. These are regions of regulation such as
		found in differential transcription, CHiP-chip, or DNA
		modification analysis. The package provides a universal
		framework suitable for identifying differential effects in
		tiling microarray data sets, and is independent of the
		underlying statistics at the level of single probes.
