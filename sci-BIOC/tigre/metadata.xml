		Transcription factor Inference through Gaussian process
		Reconstruction of Expression // The tigre package implements
		our methodology of Gaussian process differential equation
		models for analysis of gene expression time series from single
		input motif networks. The package can be used for inferring
		unobserved transcription factor (TF) protein concentrations
		from expression measurements of known target genes, or for
		ranking candidate targets of a TF.
