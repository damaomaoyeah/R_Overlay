		Batch annotation of the peaks identified from either ChIP-seq,
		ChIP-chip experiments or any experiments resulted in large
		number of chromosome ranges // The package is to facilitate the
		downstream analysis for ChIP-seq experiments. It includes
		functions to find  the nearest gene, exon, miRNA or custom
		features such as the most conserved elements and other
		transcription factor binding sites supplied by users, retrieve
		the sequences around the peak, obtain enriched Gene Ontology
		(GO) terms or pathways. Starting 2.0.5, new functions have been
		added for finding the peaks with bi-directional promoters with
		summary statistics (peaksNearBDP), for summarizing the
		occurrence of motifs in peaks (summarizePatternInPeaks) and for
		adding other IDs to annotated peaks or enrichedGO (addGeneIDs).
		Starting 3.4, we also implement functions for permutation test
		to determine the association between two sets of peaks, and to
		plot heatmaps for given feature/peak ranges. This package
		leverages the biomaRt, IRanges, Biostrings, BSgenome, GO.db,
		multtest and stat packages.
