		A test for when to use quantile normalization // A data-driven
		test for the assumptions of quantile normalization using raw
		data such as objects that inherit eSets (e.g. ExpressionSet,
		MethylSet). Group level information about each sample (such as
		Tumor / Normal status) must also be provided because the test
		assesses if there are global differences in the distributions
		between the user-defined groups.
