		Copy number prediction with correction for GC and mappability
		bias for HTS data // Corrects GC and mappability biases for
		readcounts (i.e. coverage) in non-overlapping windows of fixed
		length for single whole genome samples, yielding a rough
		estimate of copy number for furthur analysis.  Designed for
		rapid correction of high coverage whole genome tumour and
		normal samples.
