		TCC: Differential expression analysis for tag count data with
		robust normalization strategies // This package provides a
		series of functions for performing differential expression
		analysis from RNA-seq count data using robust normalization
		strategy (called DEGES). The basic idea of DEGES is that
		potential differentially expressed genes or transcripts (DEGs)
		among compared samples should be removed before data
		normalization to obtain a well-ranked gene list where true DEGs
		are top-ranked and non-DEGs are bottom ranked. This can be done
		by performing a multi-step normalization strategy (called DEGES
		for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of TCC is
		to provide the robust normalization methods for several kinds
		of count data (two-group with or without replicates, multi-
		group/multi-factor, and so on) by virtue of the use of
		combinations of functions in depended packages.
