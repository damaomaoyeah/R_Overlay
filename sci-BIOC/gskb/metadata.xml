		Gene Set data for pathway analysis in mouse // Gene Set
		Knowledgebase (GSKB) is a comprehensive knowledgebase for
		pathway analysis in mouse. Interpretation of high-throughput
		genomics data based on biological pathways constitutes a
		constant challenge, partly because of the lack of supporting
		pathway database. We created a functional genomics
		knowledgebase in mouse, which includes 33,261 pathways and gene
		sets compiled from 40 sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG,
		GeneSetDB, PANTHER, microRNA and transcription factor target
		genes, etc.  In addition, we also manually collected and
		curated 8,747 lists of differentially expressed genes from
		2,526 published gene expression studies to enable the detection
		of similarity to previously reported gene expression
		signatures. These two types of data constitute a comprehensive
		Gene Set Knowledgebase (GSKB), which can be readily used by
		various pathway analysis software such as gene set enrichment
		analysis (GSEA). As a first step, we gathered annotation
		information from 40 existing databases for mouse-related gene
		sets. These gene sets are divided into 7 categories, namely,
		Gene Ontology, Curated pathways, Metabolic Pathways,
		Transcription Factor (TF) and microRNA target genes, location
		(cytogenetics band), and others. We used information in
		GeneSetDB for some of the databases. Detailed information on
		these 40 sources and the citations is available
		http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/gskb/db/Table%201-sources.pdf
		. The gene lists from literature were retrieved manually from
		individual gene expression studies through a process similar to
		the one used to create AraPath, a similar resource for
		Arabidopsis[12]. As most expression studies upload raw data to
		repositories like GEO and ArrayExpress, we used the meta-data
		in these databases to search for publications. We scanned all
		datasets we can found and retrieved 4,313 potentially useful
		papers reporting gene expression studies in mouse. These papers
		were individually read by curators to identify lists of
		differentially expressed genes in various conditions. We
		compiled a total of 8,747 lists of differently expressed genes
		from 2,518 of papers. Each gene list was annotated with a
		unique name, brief description, and publication information,
		similar to the protocol used in MSigDB and Arapath.  These gene
		lists constitute a large collection of published gene
		expression signatures that form a foundation for interpret new
		gene lists and expression profiles. More information about this
		data is available here http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/gskb/.
		There is also a paper describing these data are currently in
		revision by Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and
		Curation.
