		Macaca mulatta (Rhesus) full genome (UCSC version rheMac2) //
		Macaca mulatta (Rhesus) full genome as provided by UCSC
		(rheMac2, Jan. 2006) and stored in Biostrings objects.  NOTE:
		In most assemblies available at UCSC, Tandem Repeats Finder
		repeats were filtered to retain only the repeats with period =
		12.  However, the filtering was omitted for this assembly, so
		the TRF masks contain all Tandem Repeats Finder results.
