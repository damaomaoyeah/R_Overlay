		Single-gene classifiers and outlier-resistant detection of
		differential expression for two-group and survival problems. //
		Messina is a collection of algorithms for constructing
		optimally robust single-gene classifiers, and for identifying
		differential expression in the presence of outliers or unknown
		sample subgroups.  The methods have application in identifying
		lead features to develop into clinical tests (both diagnostic
		and prognostic), and in identifying differential expression
		when a fraction of samples show unusual patterns of expression.
