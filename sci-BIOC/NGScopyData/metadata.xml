		Subset of BAM files of human tumor and pooled normal sequencing
		data (Zhao et al. 2014) for the NGScopy package // Subset of
		BAM files of human lung tumor and pooled normal samples by
		targeted panel sequencing. [Zhao et al 2014. Targeted
		Sequencing in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Using the
		University of North Carolina (UNC) Sequencing Assay Captures
		Most Previously Described Genetic Aberrations in NSCLC. In
		preparation.] Each sample is a 10 percent random subsample
		drawn from the original sequencing data. The pooled normal
		sample has been rescaled accroding to the total number of
		normal samples in the "pool". Here provided is the subsampled
		data on chr6 (hg19).
