		Microarray Data from Yeoh et al. in MACAT format // This is a
		microarray data set on acute lymphoblastic leukemia, published
		in 2002 (Yeoh et al.Cancer Cell 2002). The experiments were
		conducted in the St.Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis,
		Tenessee, USA. The raw data was preprocessed by variance
		stabilizing normalization (Huber et al.) on probe and
		subsequent summarization of probe expression values into probe
		set expression values using median polish.
