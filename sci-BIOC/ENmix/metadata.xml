		Data preprocessing and quality control for Illumina
		HumanMethylation450 BeadChip // Illumina HumanMethylation450
		BeadChip array measurements have intrinsic levels of background
		noise that degrade methylation measurement. The ENmix package
		provides an efficient data pre-processing tool designed to
		reduce background noise and improve signal for DNA methylation
		estimation. The package utilizes a novel model-based background
		correction method, ENmix, that significantly improve accuracy
		and reproducibility of methylation measures. The data structure
		used by the ENmix package is compatible with several other
		related R packages, such as minfi, wateRmelon and ChAMP,
		providing straightforward integration of ENmix-corrected
		datasets for subsequent data analysis. The software is designed
		to support large scale data analysis, and provides multi-
		processor parallel computing wrappers for commonly used data
		preprocessing methods, including BMIQ probe design type bias
		correction and ComBat batch effect correction. In addition
		ENmix package has selectable complementary functions for
		efficient data visualization (such as data distribution
		plotting), quality control (identification and filtering of low
		quality data points, samples, probes, and outliers, along with
		imputation of missing values), inter-array normalization (3
		different quantile normalizations), identification of probes
		with multimodal distributions due to SNPs and other factors,
		and exploration of data variance structure using principal
		component regression analysis plots. Together these provide a
		set of flexible and transparent tools for preprocessing of EWAS
		data in a computationally-efficient and user-friendly package.
