		Stepwise Classification of Cancer Samples using High-dimensional
		Data Sets // Stepwise classification of cancer samples using
		multiple data sets. This package implements the classification
		strategy using two heterogeneous data sets without actually
		combining them. Package uses the data type for which full
		measurements are available at the first stage, and the data
		type for which only partial measurements are available at the
		second stage. For incoming new samples package quantifies how
		much improvement will be obtained if covariates of new samples
		for the data types at the second stage are measured. This
		packages suits for the application where study goal is not only
		obtain high classification accuracy, but also requires
		economically cheap classifier.
