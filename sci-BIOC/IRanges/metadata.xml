		Infrastructure for manipulating intervals on sequences // The
		package provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4
		classes for storing ranges of integers, RLE vectors (Run-Length
		Encoding), and, more generally, data that can be organized
		sequentially (formally defined as Vector objects), as well as
		views on these Vector objects. Efficient list-like classes are
		also provided for storing big collections of instances of the
		basic classes. All classes in the package use consistent naming
		and share the same rich and consistent "Vector API" as much as
		possible.
