		Analysis of cell-based screens - revised version of cellHTS //
		This package provides tools for the analysis of high-throughput
		assays that were performed in microtitre plate formats
		(including but not limited to 384-well plates). The
		functionality includes data import and management,
		normalisation, quality assessment, replicate summarisation and
		statistical scoring. A webpage that provides a detailed
		graphical overview over the data and analysis results is
		produced. In our work, we have applied the package to RNAi
		screens on fly and human cells, and for screens of yeast
		libraries. See ?cellHTS2 for a brief introduction.
