		R package for the statistical assessment of cell state
		hierarchies from single-cell RNA-seq data // Cell
		differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of
		hierarchical intermediate cell-states that might be captured by
		single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational approaches for the
		assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data
		might be formalized under a general workflow composed of i) a
		metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not
		with a dimensionality reduction step), and ii) a graph-building
		algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering step).
		Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing
		flexible workflows under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell
		contributes new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies
		with statistical support while accounting for stochastic
		factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and
		functional association tests are provided to interpret
		hierarchies.
