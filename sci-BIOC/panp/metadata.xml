		Presence-Absence Calls from Negative Strand Matching Probesets //
		A function to make gene presence/absence calls based on
		distance from negative strand matching probesets (NSMP) which
		are derived from Affymetrix annotation. PANP is applied after
		gene expression values are created, and therefore can be used
		after any preprocessing method such as MAS5 or GCRMA, or PM-
		only methods like RMA. NSMP sets have been established for the
		HGU133A and HGU133-Plus-2.0 chipsets to date.
