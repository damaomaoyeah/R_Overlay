		Full masked genome sequences for Mus musculus (UCSC version mm8)
		// Full genome sequences for Mus musculus (Mouse) as provided
		by UCSC (mm8, Feb. 2006) and stored in Biostrings objects. The
		sequences are the same as in BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm8,
		except that each of them has the 4 following masks on top: (1)
		the mask of assembly gaps (AGAPS mask), (2) the mask of intra-
		contig ambiguities (AMB mask), (3) the mask of repeats from
		RepeatMasker (RM mask), and (4) the mask of repeats from Tandem
		Repeats Finder (TRF mask). Only the AGAPS and AMB masks are
		"active" by default.
