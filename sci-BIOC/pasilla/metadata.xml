		Data package with per-exon and per-gene read counts of RNA-seq
		samples of Pasilla knock-down by Brooks et al., Genome Research
		2011. // This package provides per-exon and per-gene read
		counts computed for selected genes from RNA-seq data that were
		presented in the article "Conservation of an RNA regulatory map
		between Drosophila and mammals" by Brooks AN, Yang L, Duff MO,
		Hansen KD, Park JW, Dudoit S, Brenner SE, Graveley BR, Genome
		Res. 2011 Feb;21(2):193-202, Epub 2010 Oct 4, PMID: 20921232.
		The experiment studied the effect of RNAi knockdown of Pasilla,
		the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of mammalian NOVA1 and
		NOVA2, on the transcriptome.  The package vignette describes
		how the data provided here were derived from the RNA-Seq read
		sequence data that is provided by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus
		under accession numbers GSM461176 to GSM461181
