		T cell line infections with HIV-1 LAI (BRU) // The expression
		levels of approximately 4600 cellular RNA transcripts were
		assessed in CD4+ T cell lines at different times after
		infection with HIV-1BRU using DNA microarrays. This data
		corresponds to the first block of a 12 block array image
		(001030_08_1.GEL) in the first data set (2000095918 A) in the
		first experiment (CEM LAI vs HI-LAI 24hr). There are two data
		sets, which are part of a dye-swap experiment with replicates,
		representing the Cy3 (green) absorption intensities for channel
		1 (hiv1raw) and the Cy5 (red) absorption intensities for
		channel 2 (hiv2raw).
