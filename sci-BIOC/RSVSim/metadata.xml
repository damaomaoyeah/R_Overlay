		RSVSim: an R/Bioconductor package for the simulation of
		structural variations // RSVSim is a package for the simulation
		of deletions, insertions, inversion, tandem-duplications and
		translocations of various sizes in any genome available as
		FASTA-file or BSgenome data package. SV breakpoints can be
		placed uniformly accross the whole genome, with a bias towards
		repeat regions and regions of high homology (for hg19) or at
		user-supplied coordinates.
