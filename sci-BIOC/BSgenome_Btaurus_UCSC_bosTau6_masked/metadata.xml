		Full masked genome sequences for Bos taurus (UCSC version
		bosTau6) // Full genome sequences for Bos taurus (Cow) as
		provided by UCSC (bosTau6, Nov. 2009) and stored in Biostrings
		objects. The sequences are the same as in
		BSgenome.Btaurus.UCSC.bosTau6, except that each of them has the
		4 following masks on top: (1) the mask of assembly gaps (AGAPS
		mask), (2) the mask of intra-contig ambiguities (AMB mask), (3)
		the mask of repeats from RepeatMasker (RM mask), and (4) the
		mask of repeats from Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF mask). Only the
		AGAPS and AMB masks are "active" by default.
