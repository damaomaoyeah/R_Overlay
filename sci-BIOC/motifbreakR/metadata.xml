		A Package For Predicting The Disruptiveness Of Single Nucleotide
		Polymorphisms On Transcription Factor Binding Sites // We
		introduce motifbreakR, which allows the biologist to judge in
		the first place whether the sequence surrounding the
		polymorphism is a good match, and in the second place how much
		information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism
		relative to another. MotifbreakR is both flexible and
		extensible over previous offerings; giving a choice of
		algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from public
		sources that users can choose from; these are 1) a weighted-sum
		probability matrix, 2) log-probabilities, and 3) weighted by
		relative entropy. MotifbreakR can predict effects for novel or
		previously described variants in public databases, making it
		suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design.
		Lastly, it can be used to interrogate any genome curated within
		Bioconductor (currently there are 22).
