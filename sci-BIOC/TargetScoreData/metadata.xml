		TargetScoreData // Precompiled and processed miRNA-overexpression
		fold-changes from 84 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) series
		corresponding to 6 platforms, 77 human cells or tissues, and
		113 distinct miRNAs. Accompanied with the data, we also
		included in this package the sequence feature scores from
		TargetScanHuman 6.1 including the context+ score and the
		probabilities of conserved targeting for each miRNA-mRNA
		interaction. Thus, the user can use these static sequence-based
		scores together with user-supplied tissue/cell-specific fold-
		change due to miRNA overexpression to predict miRNA targets
		using the package TargetScore (download separately)
