		Association Studies for multiple SNPs and multiple traits using
		Generalized Structured Equation Models // The package provides
		tools to model and test the association between multiple
		genotypes and multiple traits, taking into account the prior
		biological knowledge. Genes, and clinical pathways are
		incorporated in the model as latent variables. The method is
		based on Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA).
