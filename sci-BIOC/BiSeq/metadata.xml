		Processing and analyzing bisulfite sequencing data // The BiSeq
		package provides useful classes and functions to handle and
		analyze targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS) data such as
		reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data. In
		particular, it implements an algorithm to detect differentially
		methylated regions (DMRs). The package takes already aligned BS
		data from one or multiple samples.
