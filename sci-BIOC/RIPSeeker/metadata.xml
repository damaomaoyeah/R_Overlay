		RIPSeeker: a statistical package for identifying protein-
		associated transcripts from RIP-seq experiments // Infer and
		discriminate RIP peaks from RIP-seq alignments using two-state
		HMM with negative binomial emission probability. While
		RIPSeeker is specifically tailored for RIP-seq data analysis,
		it also provides a suite of bioinformatics tools integrated
		within this self-contained software package comprehensively
		addressing issues ranging from post-alignments processing to
		visualization and annotation.
