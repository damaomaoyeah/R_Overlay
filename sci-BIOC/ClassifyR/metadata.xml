		A framework for two-class classification problems, with
		applications to differential variability and differential
		distribution testing // The software formalises a framework for
		classification in R. There are four stages. Data
		transformation, feature selection, classifier training, and
		prediction. The requirements of variable types and names are
		fixed, but specialised variables for functions can also be
		provided. The classification framework is wrapped in a driver
		loop, that reproducibly carries out a number of cross-
		validation schemes. Functions for differential expression,
		differential variability, and differential distribution are
		included. Additional functions may be developed by the user, by
		creating an interface to the framework.
