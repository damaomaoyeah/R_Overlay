		Exploratory Data Analysis and Normalization for RNA-Seq //
		Numerical and graphical summaries of RNA-Seq read data. Within-
		lane normalization procedures to adjust for GC-content effect
		(or other gene-level effects) on read counts: loess robust
		local regression, global-scaling, and full-quantile
		normalization (Risso et al., 2011). Between-lane normalization
		procedures to adjust for distributional differences between
		lanes (e.g., sequencing depth): global-scaling and full-
		quantile normalization (Bullard et al., 2010).
