		Exploratory analysis and differential expression for RNA-seq data
		// Analysis of RNA-seq expression data or other similar kind of
		data. Exploratory plots to evualuate saturation, count
		distribution, expression per chromosome, type of detected
		features, features length, etc. Differential expression between
		two experimental conditions with no parametric assumptions.
