		Check a gene signature's prognostic performance against random
		signatures, known signatures, and permuted data/metadata //
		While gene signatures are frequently used to predict phenotypes
		(e.g. predict prognosis of cancer patients), it it not always
		clear how optimal or meaningful they are (cf David Venet,
		Jacques E. Dumont, and Vincent Detours' paper "Most Random Gene
		Expression Signatures Are Significantly Associated with Breast
		Cancer Outcome"). Based on suggestions in that paper, SigCheck
		accepts a data set (as an ExpressionSet) and a gene signature,
		and compares its performance on survival and/or classification
		tasks against a) random gene signatures of the same length; b)
		known, related and unrelated gene signatures; and c) permuted
		data and/or metadata.
