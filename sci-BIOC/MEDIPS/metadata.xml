		(MeD)IP-seq data analysis // MEDIPS was developed for analyzing
		data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)
		experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS
		provides several functionalities for the analysis of other
		kinds of quantitative sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq,
		CMS-seq and others) including calculation of differential
		coverage between groups of samples as well as saturation and
		correlation analyses.
