		DNA IP-seq data analysis // MEDIPS was developed for analyzing
		data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)
		experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS
		provides functionalities for the analysis of any kind of
		quantitative sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq
		and others) including calculation of differential coverage
		between groups of samples and saturation and correlation
		analysis.
