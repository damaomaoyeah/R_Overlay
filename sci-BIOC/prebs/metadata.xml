		Probe region expression estimation for RNA-seq data for improved
		microarray comparability // The prebs package aims at making
		RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data more comparable to microarray
		data. The comparability is achieved by summarizing sequencing-
		based expressions of probe regions using a modified version of
		RMA algorithm. The pipeline takes mapped reads in BAM format as
		an input and produces either gene expressions or original
		microarray probe set expressions as an output.
