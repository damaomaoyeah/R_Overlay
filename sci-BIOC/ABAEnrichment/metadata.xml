		Gene expression enrichment in human brain regions // The package
		ABAEnrichment is designed to test for enrichment of user
		defined candidate genes in the set of expressed genes in
		different human brain regions. The core function 'aba_enrich'
		integrates the expression of the candidate gene set (averaged
		across donors) and the structural information of the brain
		using an ontology, both provided by the Allen Brain Atlas
		project. 'aba_enrich' interfaces the ontology enrichment
		software FUNC to perform the statistical analyses. Additional
		functions provided in this package like 'get_expression' and
		'plot_expression' facilitate exploring the expression data.
