		Design gene based on both mRNA secondary structure and codon
		usage bias using Genetic algorithm // R based Genetic algorithm
		for gene expression optimization by considering both mRNA
		secondary structure and codon usage bias, GeneGA includes the
		information of highly expressed genes of almost 200 genomes.
		Meanwhile, Vienna RNA Package is needed to ensure GeneGA to
		function properly.
