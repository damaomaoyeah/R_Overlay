		MetaboLights MTBLS2: Comparative LC/MS-based profiling of silver
		nitrate-treated Arabidopsis thaliana leaves of wild-type and
		cyp79B2 cyp79B3 double knockout plants. Bttcher et al. (2004)
		// Indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) represents an early
		intermediate of the biosynthesis of a variety of indolic
		secondary metabolites including the phytoanticipin
		indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate and the phytoalexin camalexin
		(3-thiazol-2'-yl-indole). Arabidopsis thaliana cyp79B2 cyp79B3
		double knockout plants are completely impaired in the
		conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime and do not
		accumulate IAOx-derived metabolites any longer. Consequently,
		comparative analysis of wild-type and cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plant
		lines has the potential to explore the complete range of IAOx-
		derived indolic secondary metabolites.
