		RNA-Seq data of primary cultures of parathyroid tumors by Haglund
		et al., J Clin Endocrinol Metab 2012. // This package provides
		a CountDataSet and ExonCountSet of read counts for paired-end
		RNA-Seq data from experiments on primary cultures of
		parathyroid tumors.  The data were presented in the article
		"Evidence of a Functional Estrogen Receptor in Parathyroid
		Adenomas" by Haglund F, Ma R, Huss M, Sulaiman L, Lu M, Nilsson
		IL, Hoog A, Juhlin CC, Hartman J, Larsson C, J Clin Endocrinol
		Metab. jc.2012-2484, Epub 2012 Sep 28, PMID: 23024189.  The
		sequencing was performed on tumor cultures from 4 patients at 2
		time points over 3 conditions (DPN, OHT and control).  One
		control sample was omitted by the paper authors due to low
		quality.  The package vignette describes the creation of
		objects from raw sequencing data provided by NCBI Gene
		Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE37211.  The gene
		and exon features are the GRCh37 Ensembl annotations, release
		66.
