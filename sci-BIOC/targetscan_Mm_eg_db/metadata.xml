		TargetScan miRNA target predictions for mouse // TargetScan miRNA
		target predictions for mouse assembled using data from the
		TargetScan website. TargetScan predicts biological targets of
		miRNAs by searching for the presence of conserved 8mer and 7mer
		sites that match the seed region of each miRNA. Also identified
		are sites with mismatches in the seed region that are
		compensated by conserved 3' pairing. In mammals, predictions
		are ranked based on the predicted efficacy of targeting as
		calculated using the context scores of the sites.
