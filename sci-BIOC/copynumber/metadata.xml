		Segmentation of single- and multi-track copy number data by
		penalized least squares regression. // Penalized least squares
		regression is applied to fit piecewise constant curves to copy
		number data to locate genomic regions of constant copy number.
		Procedures are available for individual segmentation of each
		sample, joint segmentation of several samples and joint
		segmentation of the two data tracks from SNP-arrays. Several
		plotting functions are available for visualization of the data
		and the segmentation results.
