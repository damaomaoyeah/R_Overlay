		An R packaged zlib-1.2.5 // This package uses the source code of
		zlib-1.2.5 to create libraries for systems that do not have
		these available via other means (most Linux and Mac users
		should have system-level access to zlib, and no direct need for
		this package). See the vignette for instructions on use.
