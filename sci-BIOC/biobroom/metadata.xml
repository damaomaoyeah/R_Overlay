		Turn Bioconductor objects into tidy data frames // This package
		contains methods for converting standard objects constructed by
		bioinformatics packages, especially those in Bioconductor, and
		converting them to tidy data. It thus serves as a complement to
		the broom package, and follows the same the tidy, augment,
		glance division of tidying methods. Tidying data makes it easy
		to recombine, reshape and visualize bioinformatics analyses.
