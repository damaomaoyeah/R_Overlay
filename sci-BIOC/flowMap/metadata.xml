		A probabilistic algorithm for matching and comparing multiple
		flow cytometry samples // This package provides an algorithm to
		compare and match cell populations across multiple flow
		cytometry samples. The method is based on the Friedman-Rafsky
		test, a nonparametric multivariate statistical test, where two
		cell distributions match if they occupy a similar feature
		space. The algorithm allows the users to specify a reference
		sample for comparison or to construct a reference sample from
		the available data. The output of the algorithm is a set of
		text files where the cell population labels are replaced by a
		metaset of population labels, generated from the matching
		process.
