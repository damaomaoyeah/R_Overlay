		Gene Expression Signature based Similarity Metric // This package
		gives the implementations of the gene expression signature and
		its distance to each. Gene expression signature is represented
		as a list of genes whose expression is correlated with a
		biological state of interest. And its distance is defined using
		a nonparametric, rank-based pattern-matching strategy based on
		the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Gene expression signature and
		its distance can be used to detect similarities among the
		signatures of drugs, diseases, and biological states of
		interest.
