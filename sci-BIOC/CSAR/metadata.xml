		Statistical tools for the analysis of ChIP-seq data //
		Statistical tools for ChIP-seq data analysis. The package
		includes the statistical method described in Kaufmann et al.
		(2009) PLoS Biology: 7(4):e1000090. Briefly, Taking the average
		DNA fragment size subjected to sequencing into account, the
		software calculates genomic single-nucleotide read-enrichment
		values. After normalization, sample and control are compared
		using a test based on the Poisson distribution. Test statistic
		thresholds to control the false discovery rate are obtained
		through random permutation.
