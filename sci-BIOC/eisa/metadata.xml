		Expression data analysis via the Iterative Signature Algorithm //
		The Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) is a biclustering
		method; it finds correlated blocks (transcription modules) in
		gene expression (or other tabular) data. The ISA is capable of
		finding overlapping modules and it is resilient to noise. This
		package provides a convenient interface to the ISA, using
		standard BioConductor data structures; and also contains
		various visualization tools that can be used with other
		biclustering algorithms.
