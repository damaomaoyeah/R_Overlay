		miRNAtap: microRNA Targets - Aggregated Predictions // The
		package facilitates implementation of workflows requiring miRNA
		predictions, it allows to integrate ranked miRNA target
		predictions from multiple sources available online and
		aggregate them with various methods which improves quality of
		predictions above any of the single sources. Currently
		predictions are available for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus and
		Rattus norvegicus (the last one through homology translation).
