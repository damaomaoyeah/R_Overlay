		Aligned reads from RNAseq experiment: Transcription profiling by
		high throughput sequencing of HNRNPC knockdown and control HeLa
		cells // The package contains 8 BAM files, 1 per sequencing
		run. Each BAM file was obtained by (1) aligning the reads
		(paired-end) to the full hg19 genome with TopHat2, and then (2)
		subsetting to keep only alignments on chr14. See accession
		number E-MTAB-1147 in the ArrayExpress database for details
		about the experiment, including links to the published study
		(by Zarnack et al., 2012) and to the FASTQ files.
