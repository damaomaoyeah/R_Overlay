		MethylMix: Identifying methylation driven cancer genes. //
		MethylMix is an algorithm implemented to identify hyper and
		hypomethylated genes for a disease. MethylMix is based on a
		beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares
		them with the normal DNA methylation state. MethylMix uses a
		novel statistic, the Differential Methylation value or DM-value
		defined as the difference of a methylation state with the
		normal methylation state. Finally, matched gene expression data
		is used to identify, besides differential, functional
		methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that
		effect gene expression.
