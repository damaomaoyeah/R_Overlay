		Inference of differential exon usage in RNA-Seq // The package is
		focused on finding differential exon usage using RNA-seq exon
		counts between samples with different experimental designs. It
		provides functions that allows the user to make the necessary
		statistical tests based on a model that uses the negative
		binomial distribution to estimate the variance between
		biological replicates and generalized linear models for
		testing. The package also provides functions for the
		visualization and exploration of the results.
