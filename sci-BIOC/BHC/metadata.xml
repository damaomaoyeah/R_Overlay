		Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering // The method performs bottom-up
		hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet Process (infinite
		mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model
		selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge.  This
		avoids several limitations of traditional methods, for example
		how many clusters there should be and how to choose a
		principled distance metric.  This implementation accepts
		multinomial (i.e. discrete, with 2+ categories) or time-series
		data. This version also includes a randomised algorithm which
		is more efficient for larger data sets.
