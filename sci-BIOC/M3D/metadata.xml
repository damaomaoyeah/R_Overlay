		Identifies differentially methylated regions across testing
		groups // This package identifies statistically significantly
		differentially methylated regions of CpGs. It uses kernel
		methods (the Maximum Mean Discrepancy) to measure differences
		in methylation profiles, and relates these to inter-replicate
		changes, whilst accounting for variation in coverage profiles.
