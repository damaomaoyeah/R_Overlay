		RNA-seq data generated from SEQC (MAQC-III) study // The SEQC
		/MAQC-III Consortium has produced benchmark RNA-seq data for
		the assessment of RNA sequencing technologies and data analysis
		methods (Nat Biotechnol, 2014). Billions of sequence reads have
		been generated from ten different sequencing sites. This
		package contains the summarized read count data for ~2000
		sequencing libraries. It also includes all the exon-exon
		junctions discovered from the study. TaqMan RT-PCR data for
		~1000 genes and ERCC spike-in sequence data are included in
		this package as well.
