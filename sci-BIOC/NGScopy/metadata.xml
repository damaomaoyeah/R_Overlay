		NGScopy: Detection of Copy Number Variations in Next Generation
		Sequencing sequencing // NGScopy provides a quantitative caller
		for detecting copy number variations in next generation
		sequencing (NGS), including whole genome sequencing (WGS),
		whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted panel sequencing
		(TPS). The caller can be parallelized by chromosomes to use
		multiple processors/cores on one computer.
