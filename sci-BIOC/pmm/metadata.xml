		Parallel Mixed Model // The Parallel Mixed Model (PMM) approach
		is suitable for hit selection and cross-comparison of RNAi
		screens generated in experiments that are performed in parallel
		under several conditions. For example, we could think of the
		measurements or readouts from cells under RNAi knock-down,
		which are infected with several pathogens or which are grown
		from different cell lines.
