		Extra SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 141) // Extra
		SNP locations and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI
		dbSNP Build 141. The source data files used for this package
		were created by NCBI on May 1st, 2014, and contain SNPs mapped
		to reference genome GRCh38. While the
		SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP141.GRCh38 package contains only
		molecular variations of class "snp", this package contains
		molecular variations of other classes (in-del, heterozygous,
		microsatellite, named-locus, no-variation, mixed, and
		multinucleotide-polymorphism).
