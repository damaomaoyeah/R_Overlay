		Averaged gene expression in human brain regions from Allen Brain
		Atlas // Provides the data for the gene expression enrichment
		analysis conducted in the package 'ABAEnrichment'. The package
		includes three datasets which are derived from the Allen Brain
		Atlas: (1) Gene expression data from Human Brain (adults)
		averaged across donors, (2) Gene expression data from the
		Developing Human Brain pooled into five age categories and
		averaged across donors and (3) a developmental effect score
		based on the Developing Human Brain expression data. All
		datasets are restricted to protein coding genes.
