		Shape-based Analysis of Variation in ChIP-seq using Functional
		PCA // The package applies a functional version of principal
		component analysis (FPCA) to: (1) Postprocess data in wiggle
		track format, commonly produced by generic ChIP-seq peak
		callers, by applying FPCA over a set of read-enriched regions
		(ChIP-seq peaks). This is done to study variability of the the
		peaks, or to shorten their genomic locations accounting for a
		given proportion of variation among the enrichment-score
		profiles. (2) Analyse differential variation between multiple
		ChIP-seq samples with replicates. The function
		'narrowpeaksDiff' quantifies differences between the shapes,
		and uses Hotelling's T2 tests on the functional principal
		component scores to identify significant differences across
		conditions. An application of the package for Arabidopsis
		datasets is described in Mateos, Madrigal, et al. (2015) Genome
		Biology: 16:31.
