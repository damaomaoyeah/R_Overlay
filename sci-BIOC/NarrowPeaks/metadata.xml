		Analysis of Variation in ChIP-seq using Functional PCA Statistics
		// The double aim of the package is to apply a functional
		version of principal component analysis (FPCA) to: (1) Process
		data in wiggle track format (WIG) commonly produced by ChIP-seq
		peak finders by applying FPCA over a set of selected candidate
		enriched regions. This is done in order to shorten the genomic
		locations accounting for a given proportion of variation among
		the enrichment-score profiles. The function 'narrowpeaks'
		allows the user to discriminate between binding regions in
		close proximity to each other and to narrow down the length of
		the putative transcription factor binding sites while
		preserving the information present in the variability of the
		dataset and capturing major sources of variation. (2) Analyze
		differential variation when multiple ChIP-seq samples need to
		compared. The function 'narrowpeaksDiff' quantifies differences
		between the tag-enrichment, and uses non-parametric tests on
		the FPC scores for testing differences between conditions.
