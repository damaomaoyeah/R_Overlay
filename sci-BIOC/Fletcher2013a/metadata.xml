		Gene expression data from breast cancer cells under FGFR2
		signalling perturbation. // The package Fletcher2013a contains
		time-course gene expression data from MCF-7 cells treated under
		different experimental systems in order to perturb FGFR2
		signalling. The data comes from Fletcher et al. (to appear in
		Nature Communications) where further details about the
