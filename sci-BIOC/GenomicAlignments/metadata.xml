		Representation and manipulation of short genomic alignments //
		Provides efficient containers for storing and manipulating
		short genomic alignments (typically obtained by aligning short
		reads to a reference genome). This includes read counting,
		computing the coverage, junction detection, and working with
		the nucleotide content of the alignments.
