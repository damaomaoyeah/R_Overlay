		DNase I footprinting analysis of DNase-seq data // Strand-
		specific digital genomic footprinting in DNase-seq data. The
		cumulative Skellam distribution function (package 'skellam') is
		used to detect significant normalized count differences of
		opposed sign at each DNA strand. This is done in order to
		determine the protein-binding footprint flanks. Preprocessing
		of the mapped reads is recommended before running DNaseR (e.g.,
		quality checking and removal of sequence-specific bias).
