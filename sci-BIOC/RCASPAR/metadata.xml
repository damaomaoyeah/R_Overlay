		A package for survival time prediction based on a piecewise
		baseline hazard Cox regression model. // The package is the
		R-version of the C-based software \bold{CASPAR} (Kaderali,2006:
		\url{http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/12/149
		5}). It is meant to help predict survival times in the presence
		of high-dimensional explanatory covariates. The model is a
		piecewise baseline hazard Cox regression model with an Lq-norm
		based prior that selects for the most important regression
		coefficients, and in turn the most relevant covariates for
		survival analysis. It was primarily tried on gene expression
		and aCGH data, but can be used on any other type of high-
		dimensional data and in disciplines other than biology and
		medicine.
