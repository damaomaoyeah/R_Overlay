		Statistical analysis for sparse high-throughput sequencing //
		metagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it
		Operational Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are
		differentially abundant between two or more groups of multiple
		samples. metagenomeSeq is designed to address the effects of
		both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities
		on disease association detection and the testing of feature
		correlations.
