		Quality Control, Visualization and Processing for High-Throughput
		Sequencing data // We provide efficient, easy-to-use tools for
		High-Throughput Sequencing (ChIP-seq, RNAseq etc.). These
		include MDS plots (analogues to PCA), detecting inefficient
		immuno-precipitation or over-amplification artifacts, tools to
		identify and test for genomic regions with large accumulation
		of reads, and visualization of coverage profiles.
