		A "corrective make-up" program for microarray chips // The
		package is used to detect extended, diffuse and compact
		blemishes on microarray chips. Harshlight automatically marks
		the areas in a collection of chips (affybatch objects) and a
		corrected AffyBatch object is returned, in which the defected
		areas are substituted with NAs or the median of the values of
		the same probe in the other chips in the collection. The new
		version handle the substitute value as whole matrix to solve
		the memory problem.
