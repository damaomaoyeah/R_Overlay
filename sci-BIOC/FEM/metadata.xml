		Identification of Functional Epigenetic Modules // The FEM
		package performs a systems-level integrative analysis of DNA
		methylation and gene expression data. It seeks modules of
		functionally related genes which exhibit differential promoter
		DNA methylation and differential expression, where an inverse
		association between promoter DNA methylation and gene
		expression is assumed. For full details, see Jiao et al
		Bioinformatics 2014.
