		Representation and manipulation of genomic intervals // The
		ability to efficiently store genomic annotations and alignments
		is playing a central role when it comes to analyze high-
		throughput sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The package
		defines general purpose containers for storing genomic
		intervals as well as more specialized containers for storing
		alignments against a reference genome.
