		CoRegNet : reconstruction and integrated analysis of co-
		regulatory networks // This package provides methods to
		identify active transcriptional programs. Methods and classes
		are provided to import or infer large scale co-regulatory
		network from transcriptomic data. The specificity of the
		encoded networks is to model Transcription Factor cooperation.
		External regulation evidences (TFBS, ChIP,...) can be
		integrated to assess the inferred network and refine it if
		necessary. Transcriptional activity of the regulators in the
		network can be estimated using an measure of their influence in
		a given sample. Finally, an interactive UI can be used to
		navigate through the network of cooperative regulators and to
		visualize their activity in a specific sample or subgroup
		sample. The proposed visualization tool can be used to
		integrate gene expression, transcriptional activity, copy
		number status, sample classification and a transcriptional
		network including co-regulation information.
