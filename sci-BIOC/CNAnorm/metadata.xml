		A normalization method for Copy Number Aberration in cancer
		samples // Performs ratio, GC content correction and
		normalization of data obtained using low coverage (one read
		every 100-10,000 bp) high troughput sequencing. It performs a
		"discrete" normalization looking for the ploidy of the genome.
		It will also provide tumour content if at least two ploidy
		states can be found.
