		A package for the clinical proteomic profiling data analysis //
		Methods for the nalysis of data from clinical proteomic
		profiling studies. The focus is on the studies of human
		subjects,       which are often observational case-control by
		design and have   technical replicates. A method for sample
		size determination for        planning these studies is
		proposed. It incorporates routines for        adjusting for the
		expected heterogeneities and imbalances in the        data and
		the within-sample replicate correlations.
