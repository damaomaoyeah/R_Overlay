		A bioconductor package for high-dimensional exploration of
		biological network heterogeneity // Package nethet is an
		implementation of statistical solid methodology enabling the
		analysis of network heterogeneity from high-dimensional data.
		It combines several implementations of recent statistical
		innovations useful for estimation and comparison of networks in
		a heterogeneous, high-dimensional setting. In particular, we
		provide code for formal two-sample testing in Gaussian
		graphical models (differential network and GGM-GSA; Stadler and
		Mukherjee, 2013, 2014) and make a novel network-based
		clustering algorithm available (mixed graphical lasso, Stadler
		and Mukherjee, 2013).
