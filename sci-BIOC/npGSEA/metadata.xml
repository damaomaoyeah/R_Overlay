		Permutation approximation methods for gene set enrichment
		analysis (non-permutation GSEA) // Current gene set enrichment
		methods rely upon permutations for inference.  These approaches
		are computationally expensive and have minimum achievable
		p-values based on the number of permutations, not on the actual
		observed statistics.  We have derived three parametric
		approximations to the permutation distributions of two gene set
		enrichment test statistics.  We are able to reduce the
		computational burden and granularity issues of permutation
		testing with our method, which is implemented in this package.
		npGSEA calculates gene set enrichment statistics and p-values
		without the computational cost of permutations.  It is
		applicable in settings where one or many gene sets are of
		interest.  There are also built-in plotting functions to help
		users visualize results.
