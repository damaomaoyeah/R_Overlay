		A supra-hexagonal map for analysing tabular omics data // A
		supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional grid
		seamlessly consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to
		train, analyse and visualise a high-dimensional omics data. The
		supraHex is able to carray out gene/meta-gene clustering and
		sample correlation, plus intuitive visualisations to facilitate
		exploratory analysis. Uniquely to this package, users can
		simultaneously understand their own omics data in a sample-
		specific fashion but without loss of information on large
		genes.
