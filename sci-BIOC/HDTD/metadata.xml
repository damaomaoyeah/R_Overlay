		Statistical Inference about the Mean Matrix and the Covariance
		Matrices in High-Dimensional Transposable Data (HDTD) //
		Characterization of intra-individual variability using
		physiologically relevant measurements provides important
		insights into fundamental biological questions ranging from
		cell type identity to tumor development. For each individual,
		the data measurements can be written as a matrix with the
		different subsamples of the individual recorded in the columns
		and the different phenotypic units recorded in the rows.
		Datasets of this type are called high-dimensional transposable
		data. The HDTD package provides functions for conducting
		statistical inference for the mean relationship between the row
		and column variables and for the covariance structure within
		and between the row and column variables.
