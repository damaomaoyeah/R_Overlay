		A correction of the local pooled error (LPE) method to replace
		the asymptotic variance adjustment with an unbiased adjustment
		based on sample size. // Two options are added to the LPE
		algorithm. The original LPE method sets all variances below the
		max variance in the ordered distribution of variances to the
		maximum variance. in LPEadj this option is turned off by
		default.  The second option is to use a variance adjustment
		based on sample size rather than pi/2.  By default the LPEadj
		uses the sample size based variance adjustment.
