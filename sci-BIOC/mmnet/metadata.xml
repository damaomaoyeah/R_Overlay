		A metagenomic pipeline for systems biology // This package gives
		the implementations microbiome metabolic network constructing
		and analyzing. It introduces a unique metagenomic systems
		biology approach, mapping metagenomic data to the KEGG global
		metabolic pathway and constructing a systems-level network. The
		system-level network and the next topological analysis will be
		of great help to analysis the various functional properties,
		including regulation and metabolic functionality of the
		metagenome.
