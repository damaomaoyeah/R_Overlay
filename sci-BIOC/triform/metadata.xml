		Triform finds enriched regions (peaks) in transcription factor
		ChIP-sequencing data // The Triform algorithm uses model-free
		statistics to identify peak-like distributions of TF ChIP
		sequencing reads, taking advantage of an improved peak
		definition in combination with known profile characteristics.
