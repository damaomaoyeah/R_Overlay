		R Investigation of ChIP-chip Oligoarrays // The package Ringo
		facilitates the primary analysis of ChIP-chip data. The main
		functionalities of the package are data read-in, quality
		assessment, data visualisation and identification of genomic
		regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip. The package has
		functions to deal with two-color oligonucleotide microarrays
		from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains
		more general functions for ChIP-chip data analysis, given that
		the data is supplied as RGList (raw)  or ExpressionSet (pre-
		processed). The package employs functions from various other
		packages of the Bioconductor project and provides additional
		ChIP-chip-specific and NimbleGen-specific functionalities.
