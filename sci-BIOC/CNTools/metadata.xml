		Convert segment data into a region by sample matrix to allow for
		other high level computational analyses. // This package
		provides tools to convert the output of segmentation analysis
		using DNAcopy to a matrix structure with overlapping segments
		as rows and samples as columns so that other computational
		analyses can be applied to segmented data
