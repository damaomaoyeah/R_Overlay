		Rsubread: high-performance read alignment, quantification and
		mutation discovery // This R package provides easy-to-use tools
		for analyzing next-gen sequencing read data. Functions of these
		tools include quality assessment, read alignment, read
		summarization, exon-exon junction detection, absolute
		expression calling and SNP calling. These tools are highly
		efficient and accurate. They can be used to anlayze data
		generated from all major sequencing platforms such as Illumina
		GA/HiSeq/MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and LifeTech Ion
		PGM/Proton sequencers. This package can be installed on
		multiple operating systems incluidng Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD
