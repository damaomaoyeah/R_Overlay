		Subread sequence alignment for R // Provides powerful and easy-
		to-use tools for analyzing next-gen sequencing read data.
		Includes quality assessment of sequence reads, read alignment,
		read summarization, exon-exon junction detection, fusion
		detection, detection of short and long indels, absolute
		expression calling and SNP calling. Can be used with reads
		generated from any of the major sequencing platforms including
		Illumina GA/HiSeq/MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and LifeTech
		Ion PGM/Proton sequencers.
