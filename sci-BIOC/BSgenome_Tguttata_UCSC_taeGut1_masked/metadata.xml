		Full masked genome sequences for Taeniopygia guttata (UCSC
		version taeGut1) // Full genome sequences for Taeniopygia
		guttata (Zebra finch) as provided by UCSC (taeGut1, Jul. 2008)
		and stored in Biostrings objects. The sequences are the same as
		in BSgenome.Tguttata.UCSC.taeGut1, except that each of them has
		the 2 following masks on top: (1) the mask of assembly gaps
		(AGAPS mask), and (2) the mask of intra-contig ambiguities (AMB
		mask). Both masks are "active" by default.
