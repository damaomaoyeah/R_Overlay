		Cancer mutation analysis // This package implements gene and
		gene-set level analysis methods for somatic mutation studies of
		cancer.  The gene-level methods distinguish between driver
		genes (which play an active role in tumorigenesis) and
		passenger genes (which are mutated in tumor samples, but have
		no role in tumorigenesis) and incorporate a two-stage study
		design.  The gene-set methods implement a patient-oriented
		approach, which calculates gene-set scores for each sample,
		then combines them across samples; a gene-oriented approach
		which uses the Wilcoxon test is also provided for comparison.
