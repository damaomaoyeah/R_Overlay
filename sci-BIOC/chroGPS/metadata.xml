		chroGPS: visualizing the epigenome // We provide intuitive maps
		to visualize the association between genetic elements, with
		emphasis on epigenetics. The approach is based on Multi-
		Dimensional Scaling. We provide several sensible distance
		metrics, and adjustment procedures to remove systematic biases
		typically observed when merging data obtained under different
		technologies or genetic backgrounds.
