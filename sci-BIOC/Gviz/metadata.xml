		Plotting data and annotation information along genomic
		coordinates // Genomic data analyses requires integrated
		visualization of known genomic information and new experimental
		data.  Gviz uses the biomaRt and the rtracklayer packages to
		perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and UCSC and
		translates this to e.g. gene/transcript structures in viewports
		of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic
		information plotted together with your data.
