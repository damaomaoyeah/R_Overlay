		Condensed, overlapped plotting of genomic data tracks //
		Superimposing input data over existing genomic references
		allows for fast, accurate visual comparisons. The GenoView
		package is a novel bioinformatics package which condenses
		genomic data tracks to offer a comprehensive view of genetic
		variants. Its main function is to display mutation data over
		exons and protein domains, which easily identifies potential
		genomic locations of interest.
