		Tools for making reports in various formats // The ReportingTools
		software package enables users to easily display reports of
		analysis results generated from sources such as microarray and
		sequencing data.  The package allows users to create HTML pages
		that may be viewed on a web browser such as Safari, or in other
		formats readable by programs such as Excel.  Users can generate
		tables with sortable and filterable columns, make and display
		plots, and link table entries to other data sources such as
		NCBI or larger plots within the HTML page.  Using the package,
		users can also produce a table of contents page to link various
		reports together for a particular project that can be viewed in
		a web browser.
