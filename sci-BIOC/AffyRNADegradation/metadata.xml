		Analyze and correct probe positional bias in microarray data due
		to RNA degradation // The package helps with the assessment and
		correction of RNA degradation effects in Affymetrix 3'
		expression arrays. The parameter d gives a robust and accurate
		measure of RNA integrity. The correction removes the probe
		positional bias, and thus improves comparability of samples
		that are affected by RNA degradation.
