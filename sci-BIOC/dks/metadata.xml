		The double Kolmogorov-Smirnov package for evaluating multiple
		testing procedures. // The dks package consists of a set of
		diagnostic functions for multiple testing methods. The
		functions can be used to determine if the p-values produced by
		a multiple testing procedure are correct. These functions are
		designed to be applied to simulated data. The functions require
		the entire set of p-values from multiple simulated studies, so
		that the joint distribution can be evaluated.
