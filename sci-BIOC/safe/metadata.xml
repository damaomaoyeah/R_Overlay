		Significance Analysis of Function and Expression // SAFE is a
		resampling-based method for testing functional categories in
		gene expression experiments. SAFE can be applied to 2-sample
		and multi-class comparisons, or simple linear regressions.
		Other experimental designs can also be accommodated through
		user-defined functions.
