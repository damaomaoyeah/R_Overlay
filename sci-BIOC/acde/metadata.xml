		Artificial Components Detection of Differentially Expressed Genes
		// This package provides a multivariate inferential analysis
		method for detecting differentially expressed genes in gene
		expression data. It uses artificial components, close to the
		data's principal components but with an exact interpretation in
		terms of differential genetic expression, to identify
		differentially expressed genes while controlling the false
		discovery rate (FDR). The methods on this package are described
		in the vignette or in the article 'Multivariate Method for
		Inferential Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in
		Gene Expression Experiments' by J. P. Acosta, L. Lopez-Kleine
		and S. Restrepo (2015, pending publication).
