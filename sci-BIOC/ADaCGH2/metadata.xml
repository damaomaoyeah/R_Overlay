		Analysis of big data from aCGH experiments using parallel
		computing and ff objects // Analysis and plotting of array CGH
		data. Allows usage of Circular Binary Segementation, wavelet-
		based smoothing (both as in Liu et al., and HaarSeg as in Ben-
		Yaacov and Eldar), HMM, BioHMM, GLAD, CGHseg. Most computations
		are parallelized (either via forking or with clusters,
		including MPI and sockets clusters) and use ff for storing
		data.
