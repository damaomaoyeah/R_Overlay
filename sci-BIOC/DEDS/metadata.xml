		Differential Expression via Distance Summary for Microarray Data
		// This library contains functions that calculate various
		statistics of differential expression for microarray data,
		including t statistics, fold change, F statistics, SAM,
		moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also
		implements a new methodology called DEDS (Differential
		Expression via Distance Summary), which selects differentially
		expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a set of
		statistics using a weighted distance approach.
