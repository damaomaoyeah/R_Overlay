		Gene Set Enrichment / Projection Displays // R/GSEPD is a
		bioinformatics package for R to help disambiguate transcriptome
		samples (a matrix of RNA-Seq counts at RefSeq IDs) by
		automating differential expression (with DESeq2), then gene set
		enrichment (with GOSeq), and finally a N-dimensional projection
		to quantify in which ways each sample is like either treatment
		group.
