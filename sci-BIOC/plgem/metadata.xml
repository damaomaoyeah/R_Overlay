		Detect differential expression in microarray and proteomics
		datasets with the Power Law Global Error Model (PLGEM) // The
		Power Law Global Error Model (PLGEM) has been shown to
		faithfully model the variance-versus-mean dependence that
		exists in a variety of genome-wide datasets, including
		microarray and proteomics data. The use of PLGEM has been shown
		to improve the detection of differentially expressed genes or
		proteins in these datasets.
