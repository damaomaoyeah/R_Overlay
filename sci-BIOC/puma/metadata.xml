		Propagating Uncertainty in Microarray Analysis // Most analyses
		of Affymetrix GeneChip data are based on point estimates of
		expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates.
		By propagating uncertainty to downstream analyses we can
		improve results from microarray analyses. For the first time,
		the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation
		methods available to a general audience. puma also offers
		improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over
		previously available uncertainty propagation methods. Included
		are summarisation, differential expression detection,
		clustering and PCA methods, together with useful plotting and
		data manipulation functions.
