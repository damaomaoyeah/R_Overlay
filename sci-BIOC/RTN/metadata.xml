		Reconstruction of transcriptional networks and analysis of master
		regulators // This package provides classes and methods for
		transcriptional network inference and analysis. Modulators of
		transcription factor activity are assessed by conditional
		mutual information, and master regulators are mapped to
		phenotypes using different strategies, e.g., gene set
		enrichment, shadow and synergy analyses.
