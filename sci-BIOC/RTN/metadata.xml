		Reconstruction of transcriptional networks and analysis of master
		regulators // This package provides classes and methods for
		transcriptional network inference and analysis. Modulators of
		transcription factor activity are assessed by conditional
		mutual information, and master regulators are mapped to
		phenotypes using different strategies, e.g., gene set
		enrichment, shadow and synergy analyses. Additionally, master
		regulators can be linked to genetic markers using eQTL/VSE
		analysis, taking advantage of the haplotype block structure
		mapped to the human genome in order to explore risk-associated
		SNPs identified in GWAS studies.
