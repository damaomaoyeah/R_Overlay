		Identification of Novel alternative PolyAdenylation Sites (PAS)
		// Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is one of the important
		post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms which occurs in most
		human genes. InPAS facilitates the discovery of novel APA sites
		from RNAseq data. It leverages cleanUpdTSeq to fine tune
		identified APA sites.
