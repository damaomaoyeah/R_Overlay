		Single-channel array normalization (SCAN) and Universal
		exPression Codes (UPC) // SCAN is a microarray normalization
		method to facilitate personalized-medicine workflows. Rather
		than processing microarray samples as groups, which can
		introduce biases and present logistical challenges, SCAN
		normalizes each sample individually by modeling and removing
		probe- and array-specific background noise using only data from
		within each array. SCAN can be applied to one-channel (e.g.,
		Affymetrix) or two-channel (e.g., Agilent) microarrays. The
		Universal exPression Codes (UPC) method is an extension of SCAN
		that estimate whether a given gene/transcript is active above
		background levels in a given sample. The UPC method can be
		applied to one-channel or two-channel microarrays as well as to
		RNA-Seq read counts. Because UPC values are represented on the
		same scale and have an identical interpretation for each
		platform, they can be used for cross-platform data
		integration.)
