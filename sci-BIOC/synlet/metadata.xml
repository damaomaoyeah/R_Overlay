		Hits Selection for Synthetic Lethal RNAi Screen Data // Select
		hits from synthetic lethal RNAi screen data. For example, there
		are two identical celllines except one gene is knocked-down in
		one cellline. The interest is to find genes that lead to
		stronger lethal effect when they are knocked-down further by
		siRNA. Quality control and various visualisation tools are
		implemented. Four different algorithms could be used to pick up
		the interesting hits. This package is designed based on 384
		wells plates, but may apply to other platforms with proper
		configuration.
