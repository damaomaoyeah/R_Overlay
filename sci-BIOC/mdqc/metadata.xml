		Mahalanobis Distance Quality Control for microarrays // MDQC is a
		multivariate quality assessment method for microarrays based on
		quality control (QC) reports. The Mahalanobis distance of an
		array's quality attributes is used to measure the similarity of
		the quality of that array against the quality of the other
		arrays. Then, arrays with unusually high distances can be
		flagged as potentially low-quality.
