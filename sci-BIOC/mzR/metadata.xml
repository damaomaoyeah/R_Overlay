		parser for netCDF, mzXML, mzData and mzML and mzIdentML files
		(mass spectrometry data) // mzR provides a unified API to the
		common file formats and parsers available for mass spectrometry
		data. It comes with a wrapper for the ISB random access parser
		for mass spectrometry mzXML, mzData and mzML files. The package
		contains the original code written by the ISB, and a subset of
		the proteowizard library for mzML and mzIdentML. The netCDF
		reading code has previously been used in XCMS.
