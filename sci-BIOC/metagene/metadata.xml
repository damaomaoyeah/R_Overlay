		A package to produce metagene plots // This package produces
		metagene plots to compare the behavior of DNA-interacting
		proteins at selected groups of genes/features. Bam files are
		used to increase the resolution. Multiple combination of group
		of bam files and/or group of genomic regions can be compared in
		a single analysis. Bootstraping analysis is used to compare the
		groups and locate regions with statistically different
		enrichment profiles.
