		A graphical user interface to conduct a dose-response analysis of
		microarray data // The IsoGene Graphical User Interface
		(IsoGene-GUI) is a user friendly interface of the IsoGene
		package which is aimed to identify for genes with a monotonic
		trend in the expression levels with respect to the increasing
		doses using several test statistics: global likelihood ratio
		test (E2), Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972 and Robertson
		et al. 1988), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), the M (Hu
		et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007).  The
		p-values of the global likelihood ratio test (E2) are obtained
		using the excat distribution and permutation. The other four
		test statistics are obtained using permutation . Several
		p-values adjustment are provided:  Bonferroni, Holm (1979),
		Hochberg (1988), and Sidak procedures for controlling the
		family-wise Type I error rate (FWER), and BH (Benjamini and
		Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001) procedures
		are used for controlling the FDR. the inference is based on
		resampling methods, which control the False Discovery Rate
		(FDR) (both permutations (Ge et al., 2003) and the Significance
		Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), Tusher et al., 2001).
