		Similar Binding Profiles // SimBindProfiles identifies common and
		unique binding regions in genome tiling array data. This
		package does not rely on peak calling, but directly compares
		binding profiles processed on the same array platform. It
		implements a simple threshold approach, thus allowing retrieval
		of commonly and differentially bound regions between datasets
		as well as events of compensation and increased binding.
