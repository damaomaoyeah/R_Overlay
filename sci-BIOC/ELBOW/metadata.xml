		ELBOW - Evaluating foLd change By the lOgit Way // Elbow an
		improved fold change test that uses cluster analysis and
		pattern recognition to set cut off limits that are derived
		directly from intrareplicate variance without assuming a normal
		distribution for as few as 2 biological replicates. Elbow also
		provides the same consistency as fold testing in cross platform
		analysis. Elbow has lower false positive and false negative
		rates than standard fold testing when both are evaluated using
		T testing and Statistical Analysis of Microarray using 12
		replicates (six replicates each for initial and final
		conditions). Elbow provides a null value based on initial
		condition replicates and gives error bounds for results to
		allow better evaluation of significance.
