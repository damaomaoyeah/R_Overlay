		Differential Expression Analysis of NanoString nCounter Data //
		This Package utilizes a generalized linear model(GLM) of the
		negative binomial family to characterize count data and allows
		for multi-factor design. NanoStrongDiff incorporate size
		factors, calculated from positive controls and housekeeping
		controls, and background level, obtained from negative
		controls, in the model framework so that all the normalization
		information provided by NanoString nCounter Analyzer is fully
		utilized.
