		Rhythmicity Analysis Incorporating Non-parametric Methods // This
		package uses non-parametric methods to detect rhythms in time
		series. It deals with outliers, missing values and is optimized
		for time series comprising 10-100 measurements. As it does not
		assume expect any distinct waveform it is optimal or detecting
		oscillating behavior (e.g. circadian or cell cycle) in e.g.
		genome- or proteome-wide biological measurements such as: micro
		arrays, proteome mass spectrometry, or metabolome measurements.
