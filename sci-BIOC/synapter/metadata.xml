		Label-free data analysis pipeline for optimal identification and
		quantitation // The synapter package provides functionality to
		reanalyse label-free proteomics data acquired on a Synapt G2
		mass spectrometer. One or several runs, possibly processed with
		additional ion mobility separation to increase identification
		accuracy can be combined to other quantitation files to
		maximise identification and quantitation accuracy.
