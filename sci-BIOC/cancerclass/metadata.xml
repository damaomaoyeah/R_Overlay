		Development and validation of diagnostic tests from high-
		dimensional molecular data // The classification protocol
		starts with a feature selection step and continues with
		nearest-centroid classification. The accurarcy of the predictor
		can be evaluated using training and test set validation, leave-
		one-out cross-validation or in a multiple random validation
		protocol. Methods for calculation and visualization of
		continuous prediction scores allow to balance sensitivity and
		specificity and define a cutoff value according to clinical
		requirements.
