		Analysis of 4sU-seq and RNA-seq time-course data // INSPEcT
		(INference of Synthesis, Processing and dEgradation rates in
		Time-Course experiments) analyses 4sU-seq and RNA-seq time-
		course data in order to evaluate synthesis, processing and
		degradation rates and asses via modeling the rates that
		determines changes in mature mRNA levels.
