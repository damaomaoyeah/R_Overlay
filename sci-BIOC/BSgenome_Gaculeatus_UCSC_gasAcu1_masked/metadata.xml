		Full masked genome sequences for Gasterosteus aculeatus (UCSC
		version gasAcu1) // Full genome sequences for Gasterosteus
		aculeatus (Stickleback) as provided by UCSC (gasAcu1, Feb.
		2006) and stored in Biostrings objects. The sequences are the
		same as in BSgenome.Gaculeatus.UCSC.gasAcu1, except that each
		of them has the 4 following masks on top: (1) the mask of
		assembly gaps (AGAPS mask), (2) the mask of intra-contig
		ambiguities (AMB mask), (3) the mask of repeats from
		RepeatMasker (RM mask), and (4) the mask of repeats from Tandem
		Repeats Finder (TRF mask). Only the AGAPS and AMB masks are
		"active" by default.
