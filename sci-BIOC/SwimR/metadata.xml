		SwimR: A Suite of Analytical Tools for Quantification of C.
		elegans Swimming Behavior // SwimR is an R-based suite that
		calculates, analyses, and plots the frequency of C. elegans
		swimming behavior over time.  It places a particular emphasis
		on identifying paralysis and quantifying the kinetic elements
		of paralysis during swimming. Data is input to SwipR from a
		custom built program that fits a 5 point morphometric spine to
		videos of single worms swimming in a buffer called Worm
		Tracker.
