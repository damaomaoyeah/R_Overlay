		Interactive visualization and manipulation of nested networks //
		RedeR is an R-based package combined with a stand-alone Java
		application for interactive visualization and manipulation of
		modular structures, nested networks and multiple levels of
		hierarchical associations. It implements a callback engine by
		using a low-level R-to-Java interface to build and run common
		plugins. In this sense, RedeR takes advantage of R to run
		robust statistics, while the R-to-Java interface bridges the
		gap between network analysis and visualization.
