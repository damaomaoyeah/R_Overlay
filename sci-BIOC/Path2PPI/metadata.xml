		Prediction of pathway-specific protein-protein interaction
		networks // Package to predict pathway specific protein-protein
		interaction (PPI) networks in target organisms for which only a
		view information about PPIs is available. Path2PPI uses PPIs of
		the pathway of interest from other well established model
		organisms to predict a certain pathway in the target organism.
		Path2PPI only depends on the sequence similarity of the
		involved proteins.
