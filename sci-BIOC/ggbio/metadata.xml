		Visualization tools for genomic data. // The ggbio package
		extends and specializes the grammar of graphics for biological
		data. The graphics are designed to answer common scientific
		questions, in particular those often asked of high throughput
		genomics data. All core Bioconductor data structures are
		supported, where appropriate. The package supports detailed
		views of particular genomic regions, as well as genome-wide
		overviews. Supported overviews include ideograms and grand
		linear views. High-level plots include sequence fragment
		length, edge-linked interval to data view, mismatch pileup, and
		several splicing summaries.
