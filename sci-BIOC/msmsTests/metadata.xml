		LC-MS/MS Differential Expression Tests // Statistical tests for
		label-free LC-MS/MS data by spectral counts, to discover
		differentially expressed proteins between two biological
		conditions. Three tests are available: Poisson GLM regression,
		quasi-likelihood GLM regression, and the negative binomial of
		the edgeR package.The three models admit blocking factors to
		control for nuissance variables.To assure a good level of
		reproducibility a post-test filter is available, where we may
		set the minimum effect size considered biologicaly relevant,
		and the minimum expression of the most abundant condition.
