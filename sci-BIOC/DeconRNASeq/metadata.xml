		Deconvolution of Heterogeneous Tissue Samples for mRNA-Seq data
		// DeconSeq is an R package for deconvolution of heterogeneous
		tissues based on mRNA-Seq data. It modeled expression levels
		from heterogeneous cell populations in mRNA-Seq as the weighted
		average of expression from different constituting cell types
		and predicted cell type proportions of single expression
		profiles.
