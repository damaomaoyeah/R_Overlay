		Identifying Protein Binding Sites in High-Throughput Sequencing
		Data // ChIPseqR identifies protein binding sites from ChIP-seq
		and nucleosome positioning experiments. The model used to
		describe binding events was developed to locate nucleosomes but
		should flexible enough to handle other types of experiments as
		well.
