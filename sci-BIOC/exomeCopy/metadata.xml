		Copy number variant detection from exome sequencing read depth //
		Detection of copy number variants (CNV) from exome sequencing
		samples, including unpaired samples.  The package implements a
		hidden Markov model which uses positional covariates, such as
		background read depth and GC-content, to simultaneously
		normalize and segment the samples into regions of constant copy
		count.
