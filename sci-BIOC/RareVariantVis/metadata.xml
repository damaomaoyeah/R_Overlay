		Visualization of rare variants in whole genome sequencing data //
		Genomic variants can be analyzed and visualized using many
		tools. Unfortunately, number of tools for global interrogation
		of variants is limited. Package RareVariantVis aims to present
		genomic variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per
		chromosome way. Visualization is performed in two ways -
		standard that outputs png figures and interactive that uses
		JavaScript d3 package. Interactive visualization allows to
		analyze trio/family data, for example in search for causative
		variants in rare Mendelian diseases.
