		Subset of BAM files from "Pasilla" experiment // Subset of BAM
		files untreated1.bam (single-end reads) and untreated3.bam
		(paired-end reads) from "Pasilla" experiment (Pasilla knock-
		down by Brooks et al., Genome Research 2011). See the vignette
		in the pasilla data package for how BAM files untreated1.bam
		and untreated3.bam were obtained from the RNA-Seq read sequence
		data that is provided by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under
		accession numbers GSM461176 to GSM461181.  Also contains the
		DNA sequence for fly chromosome 4 to which the reads can be
		mapped.
