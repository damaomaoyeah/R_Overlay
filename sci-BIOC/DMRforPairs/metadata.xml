		DMRforPairs: identifying Differentially Methylated Regions
		between unique samples using array based methylation profiles
		// DMRforPairs (formerly DMR2+) allows researchers to compare
		n=2 unique samples with regard to their methylation profile.
		The (pairwise) comparison of n unique single samples
		distinguishes DMRforPairs from other existing pipelines as
		these often compare groups of samples in either single CpG
		locus or region based analysis. DMRforPairs defines regions of
		interest as genomic ranges with sufficient probes located in
		close proximity to each other. Probes in one region are
		optionally annotated to the same functional class(es).
		Differential methylation is evaluated by comparing the
		methylation values within each region between individual
		samples and (if the difference is sufficiently large), testing
		this difference formally for statistical significance.
