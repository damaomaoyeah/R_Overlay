		Package containing functions for ASE analysis using Meta-analysis
		Based Allele-Specific Expression Detection // The package
		implements MBASED algorithm for detecting allele-specific gene
		expression from RNA count data, where allele counts at
		individual loci (SNVs) are integrated into a gene-specific
		measure of ASE, and utilizes simulations to appropriately
		assess the statistical significance of observed ASE.
