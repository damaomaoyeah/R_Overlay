		SEPA // Given single-cell RNA-seq data and true experiment time
		of cells or pseudo-time cell ordering, SEPA provides convenient
		functions for users to assign genes into different gene
		expression patterns such as constant, monotone increasing and
		increasing then decreasing. SEPA then performs GO enrichment
		analysis to analysis the functional roles of genes with same or
		similar patterns.
