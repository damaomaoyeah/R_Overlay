		systemPipeRdata is a helper package to generate with a single
		command NGS workflow templates that are intended to be used by
		its parent package systemPipeR. The latter is an environment
		for building end-to-end analysis pipelines with automated

		applications such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and many
		others. Detailed examples for using systemPipeRdata are given
