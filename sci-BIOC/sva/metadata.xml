		Surrogate Variable Analysis // The sva package contains functions
		for removing batch effects and other unwanted variation in
		high-throughput experiment. Specifically, the sva package
		contains functions for the identifying and building surrogate
		variables for high-dimensional data sets. Surrogate variables
		are covariates constructed directly from high-dimensional data
		(like gene expression/RNA sequencing/methylation/brain imaging
		data) that can be used in subsequent analyses to adjust for
		unknown, unmodeled, or latent sources of noise. The sva package
		can be used to remove artifacts in two ways: (1) identifying
		and estimating surrogate variables for unknown sources of
		variation in high-throughput experiments (Leek and Storey 2007
		PLoS Genetics,2008 PNAS) and (2) directly removing known batch
		effects using ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007 Biostatistics).
		Removing batch effects and using surrogate variables in
		differential expression analysis have been shown to reduce
		dependence, stabilize error rate estimates, and improve
		reproducibility, see (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics, 2008
		PNAS or Leek et al. 2011 Nat. Reviews Genetics). Surrogate
		variable analysis and ComBat were developed in the context of
		microarray experiments, but may be used as a general tool for
		high throughput data sets where dependence may be involved.
