		Characterization of Alternative Splicing based on Paired-End
		Reads // Infer alternative splicing from paired-end RNA-seq
		data. The model is based on counting paths across exons, rather
		than pairwise exon connections, and estimates the fragment size
		and start distributions non-parametrically, which improves
		estimation precision.
