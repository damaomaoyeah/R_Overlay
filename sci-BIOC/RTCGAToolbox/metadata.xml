		A new tool for exporting TCGA Firehose data // Managing data from
		large scale projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for
		further analysis is an important and time consuming step for
		research projects. Several efforts, such as Firehose project,
		make TCGA pre-processed data publicly available via web
		services and data portals but it requires managing, downloading
		and preparing the data for following steps. We developed an
		open source and extensible R based data client for Firehose
		pre-processed data and demonstrated its use with sample case
		studies. Results showed that RTCGAToolbox could improve data
		management for researchers who are interested with TCGA data.
		In addition, it can be integrated with other analysis pipelines
		for following data analysis.
