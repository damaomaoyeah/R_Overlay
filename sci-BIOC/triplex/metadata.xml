		Search and visualize intramolecular triplex-forming sequences in
		DNA // This package provides functions for identification and
		visualization of potential intramolecular triplex patterns in
		DNA sequence. The main functionality is to detect the positions
		of subsequences capable of folding into an intramolecular
		triplex (H-DNA) in a much larger sequence. The potential H-DNA
		(triplexes) should be made of as many cannonical nucleotide
		triplets as possible. The package includes visualization
		showing the exact base-pairing in 1D, 2D or 3D.
