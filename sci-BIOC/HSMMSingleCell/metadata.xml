		Single-cell RNA-Seq for differentiating human skeletal muscle
		myoblasts (HSMM) // Skeletal myoblasts undergo a well-
		characterized sequence of morphological and transcriptional
		changes during differentiation. In this experiment, primary
		human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMM) were expanded under high
		mitogen conditions (GM) and then differentiated by switching to
		low-mitogen media (DM).  RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced from
		each of several hundred cells taken over a time-course of
		serum-induced differentiation. Between 49 and 77 cells were
		captured at each of four time points (0, 24, 48, 72 hours)
		following serum switch using the Fluidigm C1 microfluidic
		system. RNA from each cell was isolated and used to construct
		mRNA-Seq libraries, which were then sequenced to a depth of ~4
		million reads per library, resulting in a complete gene
		expression profile for each cell.
