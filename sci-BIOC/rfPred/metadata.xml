		Assign rfPred functional prediction scores to a missense variants
		list // Based on external numerous data files where rfPred
		scores are pre-calculated on all genomic positions of the human
		exome, the package gives rfPred scores to missense variants
		identified by the chromosome, the position (hg19 version), the
		referent and alternative nucleotids and the uniprot identifier
		of the protein. Note that for using the package, the user has
		to be connected on the Internet or to download the TabixFile
		and index (approximately 3.3 Go).
