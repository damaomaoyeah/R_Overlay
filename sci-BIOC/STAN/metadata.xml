		STrand-specific ANnotation of genomic data // STAN (STrand-specic
		ANnotation of genomic data) implements bidirectional Hidden
		Markov Models (bdHMM), which are designed for studying directed
		genomic processes, such as gene transcription, DNA replication,
		recombination or DNA repair by integrating genomic data. bdHMMs
		model a sequence of successive observations (e.g. ChIP or RNA
		measurements along the genome) by a discrete number of
		'directed genomic states', which e.g. reflect distinct genome-
		associated complexes. Unlike standard HMM approaches, bdHMMs
		allow the integration of strand-specific (e.g. RNA) and non
		strand-specific data (e.g. ChIP).
