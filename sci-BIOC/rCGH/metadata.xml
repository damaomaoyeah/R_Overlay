		Comprehensive Pipeline for Analyzing and Visualizing Agilent and
		Affymetrix Array-Based CGH Data // A comprehensive pipeline for
		analyzing and interactively visualizing genomic profiles
		generated through Agilent and Affymetrix microarrays. As
		inputs, rCGH supports Agilent dual-color Feature Extraction
		files (.txt), from 44 to 400K, and Affymetrix SNP6.0 and
		cytoScan probeset.txt, cychp.txt, and cnchp.txt files, exported
		from ChAS or Affymetrix Power Tools. This package takes over
		all the steps required for a genomic profile analysis, from
		reading the files to the segmentation and genes annotations,
		and provides several visualization functions (static or
		interactive) which facilitate profiles interpretation. Input
		files can be in compressed format, e.g. .bz2 or .gz.
