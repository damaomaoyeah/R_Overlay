		VegaMC: A Package Implementing a Variational Piecewise Smooth
		Model for Identification of Driver Chromosomal Imbalances in
		Cancer // This package enables the detection of driver
		chromosomal imbalances including loss of heterozygosity (LOH)
		from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data.
		VegaMC performs a joint segmentation of a dataset and uses a
		statistical framework to distinguish between driver and
		passenger mutation. VegaMC has been implemented so that it can
		be immediately integrated with the output produced by PennCNV
		tool. In addition, VegaMC produces in output two web pages that
		allows a rapid navigation between both the detected regions and
		the altered genes. In the web page that summarizes the altered
		genes, the link to the respective Ensembl gene web page is
		reported.
