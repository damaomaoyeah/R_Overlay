		Affymetrix File Parsing SDK // Package for parsing Affymetrix
		files (CDF, CEL, CHP, BPMAP, BAR).  It provides methods for
		fast and memory efficient parsing of Affymetrix files using the
		Affymetrix' Fusion SDK.  Both ASCII- and binary-based files are
		supported.  Currently, there are methods for reading chip
		definition file (CDF) and a cell intensity file (CEL).  These
		files can be read either in full or in part.  For example,
		probe signals from a few probesets can be extracted very
		quickly from a set of CEL files into a convenient list
		structure.
