		Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of RNA-Seq Data: integrating
		differential expression and splicing // The package generally
		provides methods for gene set enrichment analysis of high-
		throughput RNA-Seq data by integrating differential expression
		and splicing. It uses negative binomial distribution to model
		read count data, which accounts for sequencing biases and
		biological variation. Based on permutation tests, statistical
		significance can also be achieved regarding each gene's
		differential expression and splicing, respectively.
