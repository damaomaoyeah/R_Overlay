		Methods to Find Pathways with Significantly Different Variability
		// This package contains the functions to find the pathways
		that have significantly different variability than a reference
		gene set. It also finds the categories from this pathway that
		are significant where each category is a cluster of genes. The
		genes are separated into clusters by their level of
		variability.
