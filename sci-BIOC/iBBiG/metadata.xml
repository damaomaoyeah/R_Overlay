		Iterative Binary Biclustering of Genesets // iBBiG is a bi-
		clustering algorithm which is optimizes for binary data
		analysis. We apply it to meta-gene set analysis of large
		numbers of gene expression datasets. The iterative algorithm
		extracts groups of phenotypes from multiple studies that are
		associated with similar gene sets. iBBiG does not require prior
		knowledge of the number or scale of clusters and allows
		discovery of clusters with diverse sizes
