		Testing of SNPs and SNP Interactions in Case-Parent Trio Studies
		// Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT. This
		package furthermore contains functions for computing pairwise
		values of LD measures and for identifying LD blocks, as well as
		functions for setting up matched case pseudo-control genotype
		data for case-parent trios in order to run trio logic
		regression, for imputing missing genotypes in trios, for
		simulating case-parent trios with disease risk dependent on SNP
		interaction, and for power and sample size calculation in trio
		data.
