		An R package for pathway analysis using topological information
		// PathNet uses topological information present in pathways and
		differential expression levels of genes (obtained from
		microarray experiment) to identify pathways that are 1)
		significantly enriched and 2) associated with each other in the
		context of differential expression. The algorithm is described
		in: PathNet: A tool for pathway analysis using topological
		information. Dutta B, Wallqvist A, and Reifman J. Source Code
		for Biology and Medicine 2012 Sep 24;7(1):10.
