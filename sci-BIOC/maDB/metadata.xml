		Microarray database and utility functions for microarray data
		analysis. // maDB allows to create a simple microarray database
		to store microarray experiments and annotation data into it.
		Affymetrix GeneChip expression values as well as values from
		two color microarrays can be stored into the database. Whole
		experiments or subsets from a experiment (or also values for a
		subset of genes in a subset of microarrays) can be fetched back
		to R. Additionally maDB provides different utility functions
		for the microarray data analysis like functions to draw MA
		plots or volcano plots with the data points color coded
		according to the local point density or functions that allow a
		replicate handling of miroarrays.
