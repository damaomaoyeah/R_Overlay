		RangedSummarizedExperiment for time course RNA-Seq of fission
		yeast in response to stress, by Leong et al., Nat Commun 2014.
		// This package provides a RangedSummarizedExperiment object of
		read counts in genes for a time course RNA-Seq experiment of
		fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) in response to
		oxidative stress (1M sorbitol treatment) at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120
		and 180 mins. The samples are further divided between a wild-
		type group and a group with deletion of atf21. The read count
		matrix was prepared and provided by the author of the study:
		Leong HS, Dawson K, Wirth C, Li Y, Connolly Y, Smith DL,
		Wilkinson CR, Miller CJ. "A global non-coding RNA system
		modulates fission yeast protein levels in response to stress".
		Nat Commun 2014 May 23;5:3947. PMID: 24853205. GEO: GSE56761.
