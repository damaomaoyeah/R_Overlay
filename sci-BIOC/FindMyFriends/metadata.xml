		Microbial Comparative Genomics in R // A framework for doing
		microbial comparative genomics in R. The main purpose of the
		package is assisting in the creation of pangenome matrices
		where genes from related organisms are grouped by similarity,
		as well as the analysis of these data. FindMyFriends provides
		many novel approaches to doing pangenome analysis and supports
		a gene grouping algorithm that scales linearly, thus making the
		creation of huge pangenomes feasible.
