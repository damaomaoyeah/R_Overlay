		Robust Analysis of MicroArrays // Robust estimation of cDNA
		microarray intensities with replicates. The package uses a
		Bayesian hierarchical model for the robust estimation. Outliers
		are modeled explicitly using a t-distribution, and the model
		also addresses classical issues such as design effects,
		normalization, transformation, and nonconstant variance.
