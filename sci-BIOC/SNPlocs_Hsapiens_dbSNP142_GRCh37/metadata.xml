		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 142) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build
		142. The source data files used for this package were created
		by NCBI on October 14, 2014, and contain SNPs mapped to
		reference genome GRCh37.p13. WARNING: Note that the GRCh37.p13
		genome is a patched version of GRCh37 but the patch doesn't
		alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT. GRCh37 itself is the same as
		the hg19 genome from UCSC *except* for the mitochondrion
		chromosome. Therefore, the SNPs in this package can be
		"injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 and they will land at
		the correct location but this injection will exclude chrM (i.e.
		nothing will be injected in that sequence).
