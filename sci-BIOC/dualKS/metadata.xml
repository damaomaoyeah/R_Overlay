		Dual KS Discriminant Analysis and Classification // This package
		implements a Kolmogorov Smirnov rank-sum based algorithm for
		training (i.e. discriminant analysis--identification of genes
		that discriminate between classes) and classification of gene
		expression data sets.  One of the chief strengths of this
		approach is that it is amenable to the "multiclass" problem.
		That is, it can discriminate between more than 2 classes.
