		Oscope - A statistical pipeline for identifying oscillatory genes
		in unsynchronized single cell RNA-seq // Oscope is a
		statistical pipeline developed to identifying and recovering
		the base cycle profiles of oscillating genes in an
		unsynchronized single cell RNA-seq experiment. The Oscope
		pipeline includes three modules: a sine model module to search
		for candidate oscillator pairs; a K-medoids clustering module
		to cluster candidate oscillators into groups; and an extended
		nearest insertion module to recover the base cycle order for
		each oscillator group.
