		Inference for predictive networks designed for (but not limited
		to) genomic data // This package contains a set of functions
		related to network inference combining genomic data and prior
		information extracted from biomedical literature and structured
		biological databases. The main function is able to generate
		networks using Bayesian or regression-based inference methods;
		while the former is limited to  100 of variables, the latter
		may infer networks with hundreds of variables. Several
		statistics at the edge and node levels have been implemented
		(edge stability, predictive ability of each node, ...) in order
		to help the user to focus on high quality subnetworks.
		Ultimately, this package is used in the 'Predictive Networks'
		web application developed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
		in collaboration with Entagen.
