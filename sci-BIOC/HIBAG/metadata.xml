		HLA Genotype Imputation with Attribute Bagging // It is a
		software package for imputing HLA types using SNP data, and
		relies on a training set of HLA and SNP genotypes. HIBAG can be
		used by researchers with published parameter estimates instead
		of requiring access to large training sample datasets. It
		combines the concepts of attribute bagging, an ensemble
		classifier method, with haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA
		types. Attribute bagging is a technique which improves the
		accuracy and stability of classifier ensembles using bootstrap
		aggregating and random variable selection.
