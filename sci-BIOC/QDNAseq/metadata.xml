		Quantitative DNA sequencing for chromosomal aberrations //
		Quantitative DNA sequencing for chromosomal aberrations. The
		genome is divided into non-overlapping fixed-sized bins, number
		of sequence reads in each counted, adjusted with a simultaneous
		two-dimensional loess correction for sequence mappability and
		GC content, and filtered to remove spurious regions in the
		genome. Downstream steps of segmentation and calling are also
		implemented via packages DNAcopy and CGHcall, respectively.
