		Barnes Benchmark Illumina Tissues Titration Data // The Barnes
		benchmark dataset can be used  to evaluate the algorithms for
		Illumina microarrays. It measured a titration series of two
		human tissues, blood and placenta, and includes six samples
		with the titration ratio of blood and placenta as 100:0, 95:5,
		75:25, 50:50, 25:75 and 0:100. The samples were hybridized on
		HumanRef-8 BeadChip (Illumina, Inc) in duplicate. The data is
		loaded as an LumiBatch Object (see documents in the lumi
		package).
