		An extension of the bigmemory package with added safety,
		convenience, and a factor class // This package defines a
		"BigMatrix" ReferenceClass which adds safety and convenience
		features to the filebacked.big.matrix class from the bigmemory
		package. BigMatrix protects against segfaults by monitoring and
		gracefully restoring the connection to on-disk data and it also
		protects against accidental data modification with a
		filesystem-based permissions system. We provide utilities for
		using BigMatrix-derived classes as assayData matrices within
		the Biobase package's eSet family of classes. BigMatrix
		provides some optimizations related to attaching to, and
		indexing into, file-backed matrices with dimnames.
		Additionally, the package provides a "BigMatrixFactor" class, a
		file-backed matrix with factor properties.
