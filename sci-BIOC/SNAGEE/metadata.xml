		Signal-to-Noise applied to Gene Expression Experiments // Signal-
		to-Noise applied to Gene Expression Experiments. Signal-to-
		noise ratios can be used as a proxy for quality of gene
		expression studies and samples. The SNRs can be calculated on
		any gene expression data set as long as gene IDs are available,
		no access to the raw data files is necessary. This allows to
		flag problematic studies and samples in any public data set.
