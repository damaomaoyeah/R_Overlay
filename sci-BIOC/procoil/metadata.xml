		Prediction of Oligomerization of Coiled Coil Proteins // The
		procoil package allows to predict whether a coiled coil
		sequence (amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more
		likely to form a dimer or more likely to form a trimer. The
		predict function not only computes the prediction itself, but
		also a profile which allows to determine the strengths to which
		the individual residues are indicative for either class.
		Profiles can also be plotted and exported to files.
