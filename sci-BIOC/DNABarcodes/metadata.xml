		A tool for creating and analysing DNA barcodes used in Next
		Generation Sequencing multiplexing experiments // The package
		offers a function to create DNA barcode sets capable of
		correcting insertion, deletion, and substitution errors.
		Existing barcodes can be analysed regarding their minimal,
		maximal and average distances between barcodes. Finally, reads
		that start with a (possibly mutated) barcode can be
		demultiplexed, i.e., assigned to their original reference
		barcode.
