		Fast lasso-based isoform prediction as a flow problem // Flipflop
		discovers which isoforms of a gene are expressed in a given
		sample together with their abundances, based on RNA-Seq read
		data. It takes an alignment file in SAM format as input. It can
		also discover transcripts from several samples simultaneously,
		increasing statistical power.
