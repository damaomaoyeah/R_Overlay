		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 144) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build
		144. The source data files used for this package were created
		by NCBI on May 30, 2015, and contain SNPs mapped to reference
		genome GRCh38.p2 (a patched version of GRCh38 that doesn't
		alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT). Note that these SNPs can be
		"injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.GRCh38 or in
		BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.
