		SNP locations for Homo sapiens (dbSNP Build 144) // SNP locations
		and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build
		144. The source data files used for this package were created
		by NCBI on May 30, 2015, and contain SNPs mapped to reference
		genome GRCh37.p13. WARNING: Note that the GRCh37.p13 genome is
		a patched version of GRCh37 however the patch doesn't alter
		chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT. GRCh37 itself is the same as the
		hg19 genome from UCSC *except* for the mitochondrion
		chromosome. Therefore, the SNPs in this package can be
		"injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 and they will land at
		the correct location but this injection will exclude chrM (i.e.
		nothing will be injected in that sequence).
