		Spatial Analysis of Network Associations // This package provides
		methods for measuring the strength of association between a
		network and a phenotype. It does this by measuring clustering
		of the phenotype across the network (Knet). Vertices can also
		be individually ranked by their strength of association with
		high-weight vertices (Knode).
