		Combinatorial Polyfunctionality Analysis of Single Cells //
		COMPASS is a statistical framework that enables unbiased
		analysis of antigen-specific T-cell subsets. COMPASS uses a
		Bayesian hierarchical framework to model all observed cell-
		subsets and select the most likely to be antigen-specific while
		regularizing the small cell counts that often arise in multi-
		parameter space. The model provides a posterior probability of
		specificity for each cell subset and each sample, which can be
		used to profile a subject's immune response to external stimuli
		such as infection or vaccination.
