		Operating characteristics plus sample size and local fdr for
		microarray experiments // This package allows to characterize
		the operating characteristics of a microarray experiment, i.e.
		the trade-off between false discovery rate and the power to
		detect truly regulated genes. The package includes tools both
		for planned experiments (for sample size assessment) and for
		already collected data (identification of differentially
		expressed genes).
