		Copy number information from targeted sequencing using off-target
		reads // CopywriteR extracts DNA copy number information from
		targeted sequencing by utiizing off-target reads. It allows for
		extracting uniformly distributed copy number information, can
		be used without reference, and can be applied to sequencing
		data obtained from various techniques including chromatin
		immunoprecipitation and target enrichment on small gene panels.
		Thereby, CopywriteR constitutes a widely applicable alternative
		to available copy number detection tools.
