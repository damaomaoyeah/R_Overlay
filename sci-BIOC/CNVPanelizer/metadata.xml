		Reliable CNV detection in targeted sequencing applications // A
		method that allows for the use of a collection of non-matched
		normal tissue samples. Our approach uses a non-parametric
		bootstrap subsampling of the available reference samples to
		estimate the distribution of read counts from targeted
		sequencing. As inspired by random forest, this is combined with
		a procedure that subsamples the amplicons associated with each
		of the targeted genes. The obtained information allows us to
		reliably classify the copy number aberrations on the gene
		level.
