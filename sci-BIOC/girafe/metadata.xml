		Genome Intervals and Read Alignments for Functional Exploration
		// The package 'girafe' deals with the genome-level
		representation of aligned reads from next-generation sequencing
		data. It contains an object class for enabling a detailed
		description of genome intervals with aligned reads and
		functions for comparing, visualising, exporting and working
		with such intervals and the aligned reads. As such, the package
		interacts with and provides a link between the packages
		ShortRead, IRanges and genomeIntervals.
