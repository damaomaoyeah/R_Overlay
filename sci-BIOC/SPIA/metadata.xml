		Signaling Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) using combined evidence
		of pathway over-representation and unusual signaling
		perturbations // This package implements the Signaling Pathway
		Impact Analysis (SPIA) which uses the information form a list
		of differentially expressed genes and their log fold changes
		together with signaling pathways topology, in order to identify
