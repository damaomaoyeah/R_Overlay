		An annotation and visualization package for multi-types and
		multi-groups expression data in KEGG pathway // KEGGprofile is
		an annotation and visualization tool which integrated the
		expression profiles and the function annotation in KEGG pathway
		maps. The multi-types and multi-groups expression data can be
		visualized in one pathway map. KEGGprofile facilitated more
		detailed analysis about the specific function changes inner
		pathway or temporal correlations in different genes and
		samples.
