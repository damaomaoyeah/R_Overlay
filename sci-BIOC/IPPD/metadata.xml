		Isotopic peak pattern deconvolution for Protein Mass Spectrometry
		by template matching // The package provides functionality to
		extract isotopic peak patterns from raw mass spectra. This is
		done by fitting a large set of template basis functions to the
		raw spectrum using either nonnegative least squares or least
		absolute deviation fittting. The package offers a flexible
		function which tries to estimate model parameters in a way
		tailored to the peak shapes in the data. The package also
		provides functionality to process LCMS runs.
