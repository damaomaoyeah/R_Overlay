		TCGAbiolinks: An R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis
		with TCGA data // The aim of TCGAbiolinks is : i) facilitate
		the TCGA open-access data retrieval, ii) prepare the data using
		the appropriate pre-processing strategies, iii) provide the
		means to carry out different standard analyses and iv) allow
		the user to download a specific version of the data and thus to
		easily reproduce earlier research results. In more detail, the
		package provides multiple methods for analysis (e.g.,
		differential expression analysis, identifying differentially
		methylated regions) and methods for visualization (e.g.,
		survival plots, volcano plots, starburst plots) in order to
		easily develop complete analysis pipelines.
