		Test for differential expression for RNA-seq data // We developed
		a novel algorithm, XBSeq, where a statistical model was
		established based on the assumption that observed signals are
		the convolution of true expression signals and sequencing
		noises. The mapped reads in non-exonic regions are considered
		as sequencing noises, which follows a Poisson distribution.
		Given measureable observed and noise signals from RNA-seq data,
		true expression signals, assuming governed by the negative
		binomial distribution, can be delineated and thus the accurate
		detection of differential expressed genes.
