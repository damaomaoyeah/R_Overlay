		Methods to Find the Gene Expression Modules that Represent the
		Drivers of Kauffman's Attractor Landscape // This package
		contains the functions to find the gene expression modules that
		represent the drivers of Kauffman's attractor landscape. The
		modules are the core attractor pathways that discriminate
		between different cell types of groups of interest. Each
		pathway has a set of synexpression groups, which show
		transcriptionally-coordinated changes in gene expression.
