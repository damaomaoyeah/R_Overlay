		Normalization of array CGH data with imbalanced aberrations. //
		Normalization and centralization of array comparative genomic
		hybridization (aCGH) data. The algorithm uses an iterative
		procedure that effectively eliminates the influence of
		imbalanced copy numbers. This leads to a more reliable
		assessment of copy number alterations (CNAs).
