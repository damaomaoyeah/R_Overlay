		Quality control for target capture experiments // Target capture
		experiments combine hybridization-based (in solution or on
		microarrays) capture and enrichment of genomic regions of
		interest (e.g. the exome) with high throughput sequencing of
		the captured DNA fragments. This package provides
		functionalities for assessing and visualizing the quality of
		the target enrichment process, like specificity and sensitivity
		of the capture, per-target read coverage and so on.
