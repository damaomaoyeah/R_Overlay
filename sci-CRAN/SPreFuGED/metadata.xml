		Selecting a Predictive Function for a Given Gene Expression Data
		// The recent advancement of high-throughput technologies has
		led to frequent utilization of gene expression and other
		"omics" data for toxicological, diagnostic or prognostic
		studies in and clinical applications. Unlike in classical
		predictions where the number of samples is greater than the
		number of variables (np), the challenge faced with prediction
		using "omics" data is that the number of parameters greatly
		exceeds the number of samples (pn). To solve this curse of
		dimensionality problem, several predictive functions have been
		proposed for direct and probabilistic classification and
		survival predictions. Nevertheless, these predictive functions
		have been shown to perform differently across datasets.
		Comparing predictive functions and choosing the best is
		computationally intensive and leads to selection bias. Thus,
		the question which function should one choose for a given
		dataset is to be ascertained. This package implements the
		approach proposed by Jong et al., (2016) to address this
		question.
