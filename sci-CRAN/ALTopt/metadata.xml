		Optimal Experimental Designs for Accelerated Life Testing // This
		package creates the optimal (D, U and I) designs for the
		accelerated life testing with right censoring or interval
		censoring. It uses generalized linear model (GLM) approach to
		derive the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of regression
		coefficients. The failure time distribution is assumed to
		follow Weibull distribution with a known shape parameter and
		log-linear link functions are used to model the relationship
		between failure time parameters and stress variables. Any
		number of stress factors can be used but no more than 3 are
		recommended due to the computational time. ALTopt package also
		provides several plotting functions including contour plot,
		Fraction of Use Space (FUS) plot and Variance Dispersion graphs
		of Use Space (VDUS) plot.
