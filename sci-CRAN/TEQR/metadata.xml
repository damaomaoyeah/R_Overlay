		Target Equivalence Range Design // The target equivalence range
		(TEQR) design, previously named the toxicity equivalence range
		design is an up-down design patterned after the modified
		toxicity probability interval design.The TEQR design extends
		the well known 3+3 design to allow for: an explicit target
		range for the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, more subjects
		at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and specification of a
		too-toxic rate, which closes a dose level, In addition, the
		TEQR design can be implemented to target a dose based either on
		toxicity rate or activity rate constrained for toxicity.
