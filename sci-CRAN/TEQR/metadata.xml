		Target Equivalence Range Design // The TEQR package contains
		software to calculate the operating characteristics for the
		TEQR and the ACT designs.The TEQR (toxicity equivalence range)
		design is a toxicity based cumulative cohort design with added
		safety rules. The ACT (Activity constrained for toxicity)
		design  is also a cumulative cohort design with additional
		safety rules. The unique feature of this design is that dose is
		escalated based on lack of activity rather than on lack of
		toxicity and is de-escalated only if an unacceptable level of
		toxicity is experienced.
