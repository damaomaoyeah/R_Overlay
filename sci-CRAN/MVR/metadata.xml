		Mean-Variance Regularization // This is a non-parametric method
		for joint adaptive mean-variance regularization and variance
		stabilization of high-dimensional data. It is suited for
		handling difficult problems posed by high-dimensional
		multivariate datasets (p  n paradigm). Among those are that the
		variance is often a function of the mean, variable-specific
		estimators of variances are not reliable, and tests statistics
		have low powers due to a lack of degrees of freedom. Key
		features include: (i) Normalization and/or variance
		stabilization of the data, (ii) Computation of mean-variance-
		regularized t-statistics (F-statistics to follow), (iii)
		Generation of diverse diagnostic plots, (iv) Computationally
		efficient implementation using C/C++ interfacing and an option
		for parallel computing to enjoy a faster and easier experience
		in the R environment.
