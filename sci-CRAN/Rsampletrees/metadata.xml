		Sampletrees Input/Output Processing // Contains functions that
		are useful for pre- and post-processing the tree output from
		the MCMC-based C++ program sampletrees. The program sampletrees
		is used to sample gene genealogies conditional on either phased
		or unphased SNP genotype data. More information about
		sampletrees can be found at
		http://stat.sfu.ca/statgen/research/sampletrees.html . Pre-
		processing tasks involve creating the settings file, the
		haplotype estimation files (if input data is genotype), and
		error checking the settings. Post-processing involves reading
		in the MCMC output from a run of sampletrees and computing
		summary statistics.
