		Computes Pdf, Cdf, Quantile and Random Numbers, Measures of
		Inference for 19 General Families of Distributions // Computes
		the probability density function, cumulative distribution
		function, quantile function, random numbers and measures of
		inference for the following general families of  distributions
		(each family defined in terms of an arbitrary cdf G): Marshall
		Olkin G distributions, exponentiated G distributions, beta G
		distributions, gamma G distributions, Kumaraswamy G
		distributions, generalized beta G distributions, beta extended
		G distributions, gamma G distributions, gamma uniform G
		distributions, beta exponential G distributions, Weibull G
		distributions, log gamma G I distributions, log gamma G II
		distributions, exponentiated generalized G distributions,
		exponentiated Kumaraswamy G distributions, geometric
		exponential Poisson G distributions, truncated-exponential
		skew-symmetric G distributions, modified beta G distributions,
		and exponentiated exponential Poisson G distributions.
