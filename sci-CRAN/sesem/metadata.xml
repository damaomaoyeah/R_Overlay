		Spatially explicit structural equation modeling // Structural
		equation modeling (SEM) is a powerful statistical approach for
		the testing of networks of direct and indirect theoretical
		causal relationships in complex datasets with intercorrelated
		dependent and independent variables. Here we implement a simple
		method for spatially explicit SEM (SE-SEM) based on the
		analysis of variance covariance matrices calculated across a
		range of lag distances. This method provides readily
		interpretable plots of the change in path coefficients across
		scale.
