		Spatially Explicit Structural Equation Modeling // Structural
		equation modeling is a powerful statistical approach for the
		testing of networks of direct and indirect theoretical causal
		relationships in complex data sets with inter-correlated
		dependent and independent variables. Here we implement a simple
		method for spatially explicit structural equation modeling
		based on the analysis of variance co-variance matrices
		calculated across a range of lag distances. This method
		provides readily interpreted plots of the change in path
		coefficients across scale.
