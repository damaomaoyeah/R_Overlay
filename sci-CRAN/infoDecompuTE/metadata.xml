		Information Decomposition of Two-phase Experiments //
		InfoDecompuTE is capable of generating the structure of the
		analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of the two-phase
		experiments. By inputting the design and the relationships of
		the random and fixed factors using the Wilkinson-Rogers'
		syntax, infoDecompuTE can generate the structure of the ANOVA
		table with the coefficients of the variance components for the
		expected mean squares. This package can also study the balanced
		incomplete block design and provides the efficiency factors of
		the fixed effects.
