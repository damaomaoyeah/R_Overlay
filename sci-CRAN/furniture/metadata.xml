		Furniture for Applied Quantitative Researchers // Contains two
		main functions (i.e., two pieces of furniture): table1() which
		produces a well-formatted table of descriptives common as Table
		1 in research articles and washer() which is helpful in
		cleaning up your data. In addition, tableM() provides a
		descriptive table to understand patterns of missing values in
		the stratifying variable. These furniture functions are
		designed to simplify common tasks in quantitative analysis.
