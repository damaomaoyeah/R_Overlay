		Furniture for Health, Behavioral, and Social Scientists //
		Package contains two main functions (i.e., two pieces of
		furniture): table1() which produces a well-formatted table of
		descriptives common as Table 1 in research articles; and
		washer() which is helpful in cleaning up your data. Should be
		useful for quantitative research in applied fields (e.g.,
		health, behavioral, and social sciences). It also contains a
		simple operator to help with data exploration.
