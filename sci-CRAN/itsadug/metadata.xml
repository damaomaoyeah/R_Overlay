		Interpreting Time Series and Autocorrelated Data Using GAMMs //
		GAMM (Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling; Lin  Zhang, 1999) as
		implemented in the R package 'mgcv' (Wood, S.N., 2006; 2011) is
		a nonlinear regression analysis which is particularly useful
		for time course data such as EEG, pupil dilation, gaze data
		(eye tracking), and articulography recordings, but also for
		behavioral data such as reaction times and response data. As
		time course measures are sensitive to autocorrelation problems,
		GAMMs implements methods to reduce the autocorrelation
		problems. This package includes functions for the evaluation of
		GAMM models (e.g., model comparisons, determining regions of
		significance, inspection of autocorrelational structure in
		residuals) and interpreting of GAMMs (e.g., visualization of
		complex interactions, and contrasts).
