		Photometric redshift estimation using generalized linear models
		// User-friendly interfaces to perform fast and reliable
		photometric redshift estimation. The code makes use of
		generalized linear models and can adopt gamma or inverse
		gaussian families, either from a frequentist or a Bayesian
		perspective. The code additionally provides a Shiny application
		providing a simple user interface.
