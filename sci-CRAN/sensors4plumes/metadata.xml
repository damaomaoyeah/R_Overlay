		Test and Optimise Sampling Designs Based on Plume Simulations //
		Test sampling designs by several flexible cost functions,
		usually based on the simulations, and optimise sampling designs
		using different optimisation algorithms; load plume simulations
		(on lattice or points) even if they do not fit into memory.
