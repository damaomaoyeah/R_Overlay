		Power and Sample-Size Distribution of 2-Stage Bioequivalence
		Studies // Functions to obtain the operational characteristics
		of bioequivalence studies with 2-stage designs via simulations
		- Contains a function to calculate power and sample-size
		distribution of 2-stage bioequivalence (BE) studies with a 2x2
		crossover design according to Potvin et al. / Montague et al.
		modified to include a futility Nmax and modified to do the
		sample size estimation step with PE and mse of stage 1. -
		Contains further a function with the modifications according to
		Karalis  Macheras which use both point estimate (PE) and mse
		from stage 1 also for the power monitoring steps. - The third
		function power.2stage.fC() calculates power and sample-size
		distribution of 2-stage BE studies with a futility criterion
		for the PE or CI of T/R from stage 1. - The fourth function
		power.2stage.GS() calculates power of non-adaptive group
		sequential (2-stage) BE studies. - The fifth function
		power.2stage.p() calculates power and sample size distribution
		of 2-stage BE studies with 2 parallel groups. This function has
		a sibling power.2stage.pAF(), which performs exactly as
		described in A.Fuglsang 2014 - Another function
		power.2stage.ssr() allows the power calculation for 2-stage
		studies with (blinded) interim sample size re-estimation.
