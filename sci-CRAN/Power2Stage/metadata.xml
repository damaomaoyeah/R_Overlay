		Power and Sample-size Distribution of 2-stage Bioequivalence
		Studies // - Contains a function to calculate power and sample-
		size distribution of 2-stage bioequivalence (BE) studies with a
		2x2 crossover design according to Potvin et al. / Montague et
		al. modified to include a futility Nmax and modified to do the
		sample size estimation step with PE and mse of stage 1. -
		Contains further a function with the modifications according to
		Karalis  Macheras which use PE and mse from stage 1 also for
		the power monitoring steps. - The third function
		power.2stage.fC() calculates power and sample size distribution
		of 2-stage BE studies with a futility criterion for the point
		estimator or CI of T/R from stage 1. - The fourth function
		power.2stage.GS() calculates power of non-adaptive group
		sequential (2-stage) BE studies. - The fifth function
		power.2stage.p() calculates power and sample size distribution
		of 2-stage BE studies with 2 parallel groups. - Another
		function power.2stage.ssr() allows the power calculation for
		2-stage studies with (blinded) interim sample size re-
		estimation. All the functions use simulations to obtain their
		results.
