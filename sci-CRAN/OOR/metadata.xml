		Optimistic Optimization in R // Implementation of optimistic
		optimization methods for global optimization of deterministic
		or stochastic functions. The algorithms feature guarantees of
		the convergence to a global optimum. They require minimal
		assumptions on the (only local) smoothness, where the
		smoothness parameter does not need to be known. They are
		expected to be useful for the most difficult functions when we
		have no information on smoothness and the gradients are unknown
		or do not exist. Due to the weak assumptions, however, they can
		be mostly effective only in small dimensions, for example, for
		hyperparameter tuning.
