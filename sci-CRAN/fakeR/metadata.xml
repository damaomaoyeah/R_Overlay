		Simulates Data from a Data Frame of Different Variable Types //
		Generates fake data from a dataset of different variable types.
		The package contains the functions simulate_dataset and
		simulate_dataset_ts to simulate time-independent and time-
		dependent data. It randomly samples character and factor
		variables from contingency tables and  numeric and ordered
		factors from a multivariate normal distribution. It currently
		supports the simulation of stationary and zero-inflated count
		time series.
