		Monitor the Total and Peak RAM Used by an Expression or Function
		// When working with big data sets, RAM conservation is
		critically important. However, it is not always enough to just
		monitor the size of the objects created. So-called "copy-on-
		modify" behavior, characteristic of R, means that some
		expressions or functions may require an unexpectedly large
		amount of RAM overhead. For example, replacing a single value
		in a matrix duplicates that matrix in the back-end, making this
		task require twice as much RAM as that used by the matrix
		itself. This package makes it easy to monitor the total and
		peak RAM used so that developers can quickly identify and
		eliminate RAM hungry code.
