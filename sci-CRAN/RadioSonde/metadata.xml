		Tools for plotting skew-T diagrams and wind profiles //
		RadioSonde is a collection of programs for reading and plotting
		SKEW-T,log p diagrams and wind profiles for data collected by
		radiosondes (the typical weather balloon-borne instrument),
		which we will call "flights", "sondes", or "profiles"
		throughout the associated documentation.  The raw data files
		are in a common format that has a header followed by specific
		variables.  Use "help(ExampleSonde)" for the full explanation
		of the data files.
