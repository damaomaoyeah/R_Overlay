		Medical Risk and Comorbidity Tools for ICD-9-CM Data // Generates
		risk estimates and comorbidity flags from ICD-9-CM codes
		available in administrative medical datasets. The package
		supports the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Elixhauser
		Comorbidity classification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and
		the Risk Stratification Index.  Methods are table-based, fast,
		and use the 'plyr' package, so parallelization is possible for
		large jobs. Also includes a sample of real ICD-9 data for 100
		patients from a publicly available dataset.
