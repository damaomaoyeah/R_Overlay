		Functions for Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions // Provides tools
		for working with nonlinear least squares problems. It is
		intended to eventually supersede the nls() function in the R
		distribution. For example, nls() specifically does NOT deal
		with small or zero residual problems. Its Gauss-Newton method
		frequently stops with 'singular gradient' messages.
