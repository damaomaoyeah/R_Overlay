		Readable Regular Expressions // An R framework for constructing
		and managing human readable regular expressions.  It aims to
		provide tools that enable the user to write regular expressions
		in a way that is similar to the ways R code is written. The
		tools allow the user to (1) write in smaller, modular, named,
		sub-expressions, (2) write top to bottom, rather than a single
		string (3) comment individual chunks, (4) indent expressions to
		clearly present regular expression groups, (5) add vertical
		line spaces and R comments (i.e., #), and (6) test the validity
		of the concatenated expression and the modular sub-expressions.
