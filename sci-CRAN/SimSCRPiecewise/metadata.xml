		'Simulates Univariate and Semi-Competing Risks Data Given
		Covariates and Piecewise Exponential Baseline Hazards' //
		Contains two functions for simulating survival data from
		piecewise exponential hazards with a proportional hazards
		adjustment for covariates. The first function SimUNIVPiecewise
		simulates univariate survival data based on a piecewise
		exponential hazard, covariate matrix and true regression
		vector. The second function SimSCRPiecewise semi-competing
		risks data based on three piecewise exponential hazards, three
		true regression vectors and three matrices of patient
		covariates (which can be different or the same). This simulates
		from the Semi-Markov model of Lee et al (2015) given patient
		covariates, regression parameters, patient frailties and
		baseline hazard functions.
