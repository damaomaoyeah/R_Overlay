		Avoid the Typical Working Directory Pain When Using 'knitr' // An
		extension of 'knitr' that adds flexibility in several ways. One
		common source of frustration with 'knitr' is that it assumes
		the directory where the source file lives should be the working
		directory, which is often not true. 'ezknitr' addresses this
		problem by giving you complete control over where all the
		inputs and outputs are, and adds several other convenient
		features to make rendering markdown/HTML documents easier.
