		Latent Residuals Test for Epidemiology and Ecology Models //
		Latent residual tests recently developed (Lau et al. 2014)
		which are specifically designed to measure the goodness-of-fit
		of different model components of a general spatial S-E-I-R
		model commonly used in epidemiology and ecology studies. More
		restrictive model classes such as S-I-R can be accommodated.
		Note that although each test is specifically designed to be
		sensitive to one particular component of a spatio-temporal
		model, they are not theoretically restricted to only testing
		these specific aspects and can be used as a general model
		assessment tool like any other conventional model selection
		techniques. The underlying functions are coded in C++ so they
		should be generally quick.
