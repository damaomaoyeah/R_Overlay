		Calculations for All Common Subsequences // Implements several
		string comparison algorithms, including calACS (count all
		common subsequences), lenACS (calculate the lengths of all
		common subsequences), and lenLCS (calculate the length of the
		longest common subsequence). Some algorithms differentiate
		between the more strict definition of subsequence, where a
		common subsequence cannot be separated by any other items, from
		its looser counterpart, where a common subsequence can be
		interrupted by other items. This difference is shown in the
		suffix of the algorithm (-Strict vs -Loose). For example, q-w
		is a common subsequence of q-w-e-r and q-e-w-r on the looser
		definition, but not on the more strict definition. calACSLoose
