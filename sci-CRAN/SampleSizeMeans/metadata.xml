		Sample size calculations for normal means // A set of R functions
		for calculating sample size requirements using three different
		Bayesian criteria in the context of designing an experiment to
		estimate a normal mean or the difference between two normal
		means.  Functions for calculation of required sample sizes for
		the Average Length Criterion, the Average Coverage Criterion
		and the Worst Outcome Criterion in the context of normal means
		are provided. Functions for both the fully Bayesian and the
		mixed Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided.
