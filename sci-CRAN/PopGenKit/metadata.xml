		Useful functions for (batch) file conversion and data resampling
		in microsatellite datasets // There are two main purposes to
		this package. The first is to allow batch conversion of Genepop
		(Rousset 2008) input files for use with Arlequin (Excoffier and
		Lischer 2010), which has a simple GUI to analyze batch files.
		Two commonly used simulation software, BottleSim (Kuo  Janzen
		2003) and Easypop (Balloux 2001) produce Genepop output files
		that can be analyzed this way. There are also functions to
		convert to and from BottleSim format, to quickly produce allele
		frequency tables or to convert a file directly for use in
		ordination analyses (e.g. principal component analysis). This
		package also includes functions to calculate allele rarefaction
		curves, confidence intervals on heterozygosity and allelic
		richness with resampling strategies (bootstrap and jackknife).
