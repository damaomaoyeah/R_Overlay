		Exact and Asymptotic K Sample Permutation Test // An
		implementation of permutation tests in R, supporting both exact
		and asymptotic K sample test of data locations. The p value of
		exact tests is found using tree algorithms. Tree algorithms
		treat permutations of input data as tree nodes and perform
		constraint depth-first searches for permutations that fall into
		the critical region of a test systematically. Pruning of tree
		search and optimisations at C level enable exact tests for
		certain large data sets.
