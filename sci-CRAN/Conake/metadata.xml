		Continuous Associated Kernel Estimation // Continuous smoothing
		of probability density function on a compact or semi-infinite
		support is performed using four continuous associated kernels:
		extended beta, gamma, lognormal and reciprocal inverse
		Gaussian. The cross-validation technique is also implemented
		for bandwidth selection.
