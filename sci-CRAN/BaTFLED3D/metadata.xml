		Bayesian Tensor Factorization Linked to External Data // BaTFLED
		is a machine learning algorithm designed to make predictions
		and determine interactions in data that varies along three
		independent modes. For example BaTFLED was developed to predict
		the growth of cell lines when treated with drugs at different
		doses. The first mode corresponds to cell lines and
		incorporates predictors such as cell line genomics and growth
		conditions. The second mode corresponds to drugs and
		incorporates predictors indicating known targets and structural
		features. The third mode corresponds to dose and there are no
		dose-specific predictors (although the algorithm is capable of
		including predictors for the third mode if present). See
		'BaTFLED3D_vignette.rmd' for a simulated example.
