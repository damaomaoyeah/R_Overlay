		Configurable function for solving families of nonlinear equations
		// This function is designed for use with an arbitrary set of
		equations with an arbitrary set of unknowns. The user selects
		"fixed" values for enough unknowns to leave as many variables
		as there are equations, which in most cases means the system is
		properly defined and a unique solution exists. The function,
		the fixed values and initial values for the remaining unknowns
		are fed to a nonlinear backsolver. The original version of
		"TK!Solver" was the inspiration for this function.
