		Imperialist Competitive Algorithm // Imperialist Competitive
		Algorithm (ICA)
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist_competitive_algorithm
		is a computational method that is used to solve optimization
		problems of different types and it is the mathematical model
		and the computer simulation of human social evolution. The
		package provides a minimum value for the cost function and the
		best value for the optimization variables by Imperialist
		Competitive Algorithm. Users can easily define their own
		objective function depending on the problem at hand. This
		version has been successfully applied to solve optimization
		problems, for continuous functions.
