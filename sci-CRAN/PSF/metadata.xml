		Forecasting of Univariate Time Series Using the Pattern Sequence-
		Based Forecasting (PSF) Algorithm // Pattern Sequence Based
		Forecasting (PSF) takes univariate time series data as input
		and assist to forecast its future values. This algorithm
		forecasts the behavior of time series based on similarity of
		pattern sequences. Initially, clustering is done with the
		labeling of samples from database. The labels associated with
		samples are then used for forecasting the future behaviour of
		time series data. The further technical details and references
		regarding PSF are discussed in Vignette.
