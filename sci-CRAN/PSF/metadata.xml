		Algorithm for Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting // Various
		functions in Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting (PSF) takes
		time series data as input and assist to forecast the future
		value with the help of Algorithm PSF. This algorithm forecasts
		the behavior of time series based on similarity of pattern
		sequences. Initially, clustering is done with the labeling of
		samples from database. The labels associated with samples are
		then used for forecasting the future behaviour of time series
		data. The further technical details and references regarding
		PSF are discussed in Vignette.
