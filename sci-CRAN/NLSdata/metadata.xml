		An R package for National Longitudinal Survey Analysis // The
		National Longitudinal Surveys provide a wealth of sociological
		data. However, the export facilities provided by the Bureau of
		Labor Statistics result in a crude output format that requires
		a considerable time commitment from the analyst. The NLSdata
		package is a companion utility to the NLS Investigator
		https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login.jsp that
		facilitates reading, interpreting and reshaping NLS data for a
		wide variety of sociological and longitudinal analyses.
