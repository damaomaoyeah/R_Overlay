		High-Dimensional Regression and CAR Score Variable Selection //
		Implements the regression approach of Zuber and Strimmer (2011)
		"High-dimensional regression and variable selection using CAR
		scores" SAGMB 10: 34, DOI:10.2202/1544-6115.1730. CAR scores
		measure the correlation between the response and the
		Mahalanobis-decorrelated  predictors.  The squared CAR score is
		a natural measure of variable importance and provides a
		canonical ordering of variables. This package provides
		functions for estimating CAR scores, for variable selection
		using CAR scores, and for estimating corresponding regression
		coefficients. Both shrinkage as well as empirical estimators
		are available.
