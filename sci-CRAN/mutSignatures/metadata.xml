		Decipher Mutational Signatures from Somatic Mutational Catalogs
		// Cancer cells accumulate DNA mutations as result of DNA
		damage and DNA repair processes. This computational framework
		is aimed at deciphering DNA mutational signatures operating in
		cancer. The input is a numeric matrix of DNA mutation counts
		detected in a panel of cancer samples. The framework performs
		Non-negative Matrix Factorization to extract the most likely
		signatures explaining the observed set of DNA mutations. The
		framework relies on parallelization and is optimized for use on
		multi-core systems. This framework is an R-based implementation
		of the original MATLAB WTSI framework by Alexandrov LB et al
		(2013) DOI:10.1016/j.celrep.2012.12.008.
