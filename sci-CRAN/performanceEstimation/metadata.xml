		An Infra-Structure for Performance Estimation of Predictive
		Models // An  infra-structure for estimating the predictive
		performance of predictive models. In this context, it can also
		be used to compare and/or select among different alternative
		ways of solving one or more predictive tasks. The main goal of
		the package is to provide a generic infra-structure to estimate
		the values of different metrics of predictive performance using
		different estimation procedures. These estimation tasks can be
		applied to any solutions (workflows) to the predictive tasks.
		The package provides easy to use standard workflows that allow
		the usage of any available R modeling algorithm together with
		some pre-defined data pre-processing steps and also prediction
		post-processing methods. It also provides means for addressing
		issues related with the statistical significance of the
		observed differences.
