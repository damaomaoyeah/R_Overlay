		Analyzing and Visualizing Differential Correlation Networks in
		Biological Data // A method for identifying pattern changes
		between 2 experimental conditions in correlation networks
		(e.g., gene co-expression networks), which builds on a commonly
		used association measure, such as Pearson's correlation
		coefficient. This package includes functions to calculate
		correlation matrices for high-dimensional dataset and to test
		differential correlation, which means the changes in the
		correlation relationship among variables (e.g., genes and
		metabolites) between 2 experimental conditions.
