		Format R Code Automatically // Provides a function tidy_source()
		to format R source code. Spaces and indent will be added to the
		code automatically, and comments will be preserved under
		certain conditions, so that R code will be more human-readable
		and tidy. There is also a Shiny app as a user interface in this
		package (see tidy_app()).
