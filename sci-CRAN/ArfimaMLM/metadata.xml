		Arfima-MLM Estimation For Repeated Cross-Sectional Data //
		Functions to facilitate the estimation of Arfima-MLM models for
		repeated cross-sectional data and pooled cross-sectional time-
		series data (see Lebo and Weber 2015). The estimation procedure
		uses double filtering with Arfima methods to account for
		autocorrelation in repeated cross-sectional data followed by
		multilevel modeling (MLM) to estimate aggregate as well as
		individual-level parameters simultaneously.
