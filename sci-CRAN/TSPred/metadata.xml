		Functions for Baseline-Based Time Series Prediction // Functions
		for time series prediction and accuracy assessment using
		automatic ARIMA modelling. The generated ARIMA models and its
		yielded prediction errors are intended to be used as baseline
		for evaluating the practical value of other time series
		prediction methods and creating a demand for the refinement of
		such methods. For this purpose, benchmark data from prediction
		competitions may be used.
