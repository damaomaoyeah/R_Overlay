		Estimation of (Local) False Discovery Rates and Higher Criticism
		// Estimates both tail area-based false discovery rates (Fdr)
		as well as local false discovery rates (fdr) for a variety of
		null models (p-values, z-scores, correlation coefficients,
		t-scores).  The proportion of null values and the parameters of
		the null distribution are adaptively estimated from the data.
		In addition, the package contains functions for non-parametric
		density estimation (Grenander estimator), for monotone
		regression (isotonic regression and antitonic regression with
		weights), for computing the greatest convex minorant (GCM) and
		the least concave majorant (LCM), for the half-normal and
		correlation distributions, and for computing empirical higher
		criticism (HC) scores and the corresponding decision threshold.
