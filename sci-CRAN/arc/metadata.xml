		Association Rule Classification // Implements the Classification-
		based on Association Rules (CBA) algorithm for association rule
		classification (ARC). The package also contains several
		convenience methods that allow to automatically set CBA
		parameters (minimum confidence, minimum support) and it also
		natively handles numeric attributes by integrating a pre-
		discretization step. The rule generation phase is handled by
		the 'arules' package.
