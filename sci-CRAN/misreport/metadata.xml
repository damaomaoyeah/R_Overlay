		Statistical Analysis of Misreporting on Sensitive Survey
		Questions // Enables investigation of the predictors of
		misreporting on sensitive survey questions through a
		multivariate list experiment regression method. The method
		permits researchers to model whether a survey respondent's
		answer to the sensitive item in a list experiment is different
		from his or her answer to an analogous direct question.
