		Set Options if Unset // A single function 'options.ifunset(...)'
		is contained herewith, which allows the user to set a global
		option ONLY if it is not already set. By this token, for
		package maintainers this function can be used in preference to
		the standard 'options(...)' function, making provision for
		THEIR end user to place 'options(...)' directives within their
		'.Rprofile' file, which will not be overridden at the point
		when a package is loaded.
