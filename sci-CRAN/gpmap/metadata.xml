		Analysing and plotting genotype-phenotype maps // This package
		contains tools for studying genotype-phenotype (GP) maps for
		bi-allelic loci underlying quantitative phenotypes. The 0.1
		version is released in connection with the publication of
		Gjuvsland et al. (2003) and implements basic line plots and the
		monotonicity measures for GP maps presented in the paper.
		Reference: Gjuvsland AB, Wang Y, Plahte E and Omholt SW (2013)
		Monotonicity is a key feature of genotype-phenotype maps.
