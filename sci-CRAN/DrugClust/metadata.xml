		Implementation of a Machine Learning Framework for Predicting
		Drugs Side Effects // An implementation of a Machine Learning
		Framework for prediction of new drugs Side Effects. Firstly
		drugs are clustered with respect to their features description
		and secondly predictions are made, according to Bayesian
		scores. Moreover it can perform protein enrichment considering
		the proteins clustered together in the first step of the
		algorithm. This last tool is of extreme interest for biologist
		and drug discovery purposes, given the fact that it can be used
		either as a validation of the clusters obtained, as well as for
		the possible discovery of new interactions between certain side
		effects and non targeted pathways. Clustering of the drugs in
		the feature space can be done using K-Means, PAM or K-Seeds (a
		novel clustering algorithm proposed by the author).
