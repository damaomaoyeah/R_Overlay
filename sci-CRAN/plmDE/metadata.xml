		Additive partially linear models for differential gene expression
		analysis // A set of tools for identifying genes whose
		differential expression is associated with measurements of
		other covariates on a continuous scale.  These methods rely on
		generalized additive partially linear models which can be
		fitted efficiently using a B-spline basis approximation.  Still
		under development: methods for interfacing with objects
		extending the eSet class and a function to pass linear models
		in edgeR and DEseq format.
