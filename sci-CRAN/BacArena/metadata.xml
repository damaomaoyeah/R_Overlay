		Modeling Framework for Cellular Communities in their Environments
		// Can be used for simulation of organisms living in
		communities. Each organism is represented individually and
		genome scale metabolic models determine the uptake and release
		of compounds. Biological processes such as movement, diffusion,
		chemotaxis and kinetics are available along with data analysis
		techniques.
