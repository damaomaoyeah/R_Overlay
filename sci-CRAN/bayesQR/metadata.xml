		Bayesian quantile regression // Bayesian quantile regression
		using the asymmetric Laplace distribution, both continuous as
		well as binary dependent variables are supported. The package
		consists of implementations of the methods of Yu  Moyeed
		(2001), Benoit  Van den Poel (2012) and Al-Hamzawi, Yu  Benoit
		(2012). To speed up the calculations, the Markov Chain Monte
		Carlo core of all algorithms is programmed in Fortran and
		called from R.
