		Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Variable Selection from High-
		Dimensional Data // Provides a genetic algorithm for finding
		variable subsets in high dimensional data with high prediction
		performance. The genetic algorithm can use ordinary least
		squares (OLS) regression models or partial least squares (PLS)
		regression models to evaluate the prediction power of variable
		subsets. By supporting different cross-validation schemes, the
		user can fine-tune the tradeoff between speed and quality of
		the solution.
