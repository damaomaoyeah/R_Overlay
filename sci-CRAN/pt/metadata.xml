		Computational models for prospect theory and other theories of
		risky decision making // Implements (cumulative) prospect
		theory and other theories of risky decision making. A
		practically unlimited number of choices can be specified. The
		package allows for different probability weighting functions
		and utility functions to be specified, as well as their
		parameters. Other features include the ability to plot
		individual probability weighting curves and families of these
		curves, as well as individual utility function curves. Single-
		stage decision trees can be drawn. The probability simplex can
		also be drawn. Certainty equivalents and risk premiums can be
		plotted. Theoretical predictions for different risky decision
		making theories can be compared against each other and
		empirical data.
