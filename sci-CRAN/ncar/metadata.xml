		Noncompartmental Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Data for CDISC
		Standardized Parameters // Conduct a noncompartmental analysis
		as closely as possible to the most widely used commercial
		software for pharmacokinetic analysis, i.e. 'Phoenix(R)
		WinNonlin(R)' https://www.certara.com/software/pkpd-modeling-
		and-simulation/phoenix-winnonlin/. Some features include: 1)
		Use CDISC SDTM PP domain terms. 2) Automatic slope selection
		with the same criterion of WinNonlin(R) 3) Support both
		'linear-up linear-down' and 'linear-up log-down' method 4)
		Calculate partial(interval) AUC with 'linear' or 'log'
		interpolation method 5) Perform a noncompartmental analysis of
		CDISC standardized pharmacokinetic dataset (.XPT) For more
		details on noncompartmental analysis, see the reference:

		Data Analysis - Concepts and Applications. 5th ed. 2016.
