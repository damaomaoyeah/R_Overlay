		ANES Raking Implementation // Provides a comprehensive system for
		selecting variables and weighting data to match the
		specifications of the American National Election Studies. The
		package includes methods for identifying discrepant variables,
		raking data, and assessing the effects of the raking algorithm.
		It also allows automated re-raking if target variables fall
		outside identified bounds and allows greater user specification
		than other available raking algorithms. A variety of simple
		weighted statistics that were previously in this package
		(version .55 and earlier) have been moved to the package
		'weights.'
