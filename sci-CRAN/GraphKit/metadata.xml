		Estimating Structural Invariants of Graphical Models // Efficient
		methods for constructing confidence intervals of monotone graph
		invariants, as well as testing for monotone graph properties.
		Many packages are available to estimate precision matrices,
		this package serves as a tool to extract structural properties
		from their induced graphs. By iteratively bootstrapping on only
		the relevant edge set, we are able to obtain the optimal
		interval size.
