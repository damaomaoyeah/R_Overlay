		Create virtual species for species distribution modelling // This
		package includes several methods to create virtual species
		distribution map. Those maps can be used for species
		distribution modelling (SDM) study. SDM use environmental data
		for sites of occurrence of a species to predict all the sites
		where the environmental conditions are suitable for the species
		to persist, and may be expected to occur.
