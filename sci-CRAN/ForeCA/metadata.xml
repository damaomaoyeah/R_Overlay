		Forecastable Component Analysis // Implementation of Forecastable
		Component Analysis ('ForeCA'), including main algorithms and
		auxiliary function (summary, plotting, etc.) to apply 'ForeCA'
		to multivariate time series data. 'ForeCA' is a novel dimension
		reduction (DR) technique for temporally dependent signals.
		Contrary to other popular DR methods, such as 'PCA' or 'ICA',
		'ForeCA' takes time dependency explicitly into account and
		searches for the most ''forecastable'' signal.  The measure of
		forecastability is based on the Shannon entropy of the spectral
		density of the transformed signal.
