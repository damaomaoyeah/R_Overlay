		Accessing Intra-Tumor Heterogeneity and Tracking Longitudinal and
		Spatial Clonal Evolutionary History by Next-Generation
		Sequencing // A statistical framework and computational
		procedure for identifying the sub-populations within a tumor,
		determining the mutation profiles of each subpopulation, and
		inferring the tumor's phylogenetic history. The input are
		variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide
		alterations (SNAs) along with allele-specific coverage ratios
		between the tumor and matched normal sample for somatic copy
		number alterations (CNAs). These quantities can be directly
		taken from the output of existing software. Canopy provides a
		general mathematical framework for pooling data across samples
		and sites to infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that
		fall within CNA regions, Canopy infers their temporal ordering
		and resolves their phase.  When there are multiple evolutionary
		configurations consistent with the data, Canopy outputs all
		configurations along with their confidence assessment.
