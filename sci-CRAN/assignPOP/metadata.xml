		Population Assignment using Genomic, Non-Genetic or Integrated
		Data in a Machine-Learning Framework // Perform population
		assignment using a machine learning framework. It employs
		supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the
		discriminatory power of your known data set, and is capable of
		analyzing large genetic, non-genetic, or integrated (genetic
		plus non-genetic) data sets. This framework is also designed
		for solving the upwardly biased issue that was discussed in
		previous studies.
