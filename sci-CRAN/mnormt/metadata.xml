		The Multivariate Normal and t Distributions // Functions are
		provided for computing the density and the distribution
		function of multivariate normal and "t" random variables, and
		for generating random vectors sampled from these distributions.
		Probabilities are computed via a non-Monte Carlo method.
		Different routines are used for the case d=1, d=2, d2, if d
		denotes the number of dimensions.
