		Lake Temperatures Collected by Situ and Satellite Methods from
		1985-2009 // Lake temperature records, metadata, and climate
		drivers for 291 global lakes during the time period 1985-2009.
		Temperature observations were collected using satellite and in
		situ methods. Climatic drivers and geomorphometric
		characteristics were also compiled and are included for each
