		'Knitr' Helpers - Mostly Tables // Provides several helper
		functions for working with 'knitr' and 'LaTeX'. It includes
		'xTab' for creating traditional 'LaTeX' tables, 'lTab' for
		generating 'longtable' environments, and 'sTab' for generating
		a 'supertabular' environment. Additionally, this package
		contains a knitr_setup() function which fixes a well-known bug
		in 'knitr', which distorts the 'results="asis"' command when
		used in conjunction with user-defined commands; and a com
		command (com=TRUE=) which renders the output from 'knitr' as a
		'LaTeX' command.
