		Estimation and Inference Methods for Counterfactual Analysis //
		Implements the estimation and inference methods for
		counterfactual analysis described in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-
		Val and Melly (2013) DOI:10.3982/ECTA10582 "Inference on
		Counterfactual Distributions," Econometrica, 81(6). The
		counterfactual distributions considered are the result of
		changing either the marginal distribution of covariates related
		to the outcome variable of interest, or the conditional
		distribution of the outcome given the covariates. They can be
		applied to estimate quantile treatment effects and wage
		decompositions.
