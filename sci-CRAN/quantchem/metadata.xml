		Quantitative chemical analysis: calibration and evaluation of
		results // Statistical evaluation of calibration curves by
		different regression techniques: ordinary, weighted, robust (up
		to 4th order polynomial).  Log-log and Box-Cox transform,
		estimation of optimal power and weighting scheme. Tests for
		heteroscedascity and normality of residuals. Different kinds of
		plots commonly used in illustrating calibrations. Easy "inverse
		prediction" of concentration by given responses and statistical
		evaluation of results (comparison of precision and accuracy by
		common tests).
