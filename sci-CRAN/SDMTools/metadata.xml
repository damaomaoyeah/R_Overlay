		Species Distribution Modelling Tools: Tools for processing data
		associated with species distribution modelling exercises //
		This packages provides a set of tools for post processing the
		outcomes of species distribution modeling exercises. It
		includes novel methods for comparing models and tracking
		changes in distributions through time. It further includes
		methods for visualizing outcomes, selecting thresholds,
		calculating measures of accuracy and landscape fragmentation
		statistics, etc.. This package was made possible in part by
		financial support from the Australian Research Council  ARC
		Research Network for Earth System Science.
