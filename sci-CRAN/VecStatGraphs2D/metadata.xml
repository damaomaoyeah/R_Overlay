		Vector Analysis using Graphical and Analytical Methods in 2D // A
		2D statistical analysis is performed, both numerical and
		graphical, of a set of vectors. Since a vector has two
		components (module and azimuth) vector analysis is performed in
		three stages: modules are analyzed by means of linear
		statistics, azimuths are analyzed by circular statistics, and
		the joint analysis of modules and azimuths is done using
		density maps that allow detecting another distribution
		properties (i.e. anisotropy) and outliers. Tests and circular
		statistic parameters have associated a full range of graphing:
		histograms, maps of distributions, point maps, vector maps,
		density maps, distribution modules and azimuths.
