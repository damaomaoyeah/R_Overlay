		Fast and Versatile Non-Negative Matrix Factorization // This is a
		package for Non-Negative Linear Models (NNLM). It implements
		fast sequential coordinate descent algorithms for non-negative
		linear regression and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF).
		It supports mean square error and Kullback-Leibler divergence
		loss. Many other features are also implemented, including
		missing value imputation, domain knowledge integration,
		designable W and H matrices and multiple forms of
		regularizations.
