		Statistical Analysis of Fuzzy Data // The aim of the package is
		to provide some basic functions for doing statistics with one
		dimensional Fuzzy Data (in the form of polygonal fuzzy
		numbers). In particular, the package contains functions for the
		basic operations on the class of fuzzy numbers (sum, scalar
		product, mean, Hukuhara difference, quantiles) as well as for
		calculating (Bertoluzza) distance, sample variance, sample
		covariance, sample correlation, and the Dempster-Shafer
		(levelwise) histogram. Moreover a function to simulate fuzzy
		random variables, bootstrap tests for the equality of means,
		and a function to do linear regression given trapezoidal fuzzy
		data is included. Version 0.4 fixes some bugs of version 0.3
		and includes an additional function to calculate quantiles of
		samples of polygonal fuzzy numbers.
