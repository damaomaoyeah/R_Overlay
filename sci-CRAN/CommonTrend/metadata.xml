		Extract and plot common trends from a cointegration system.
		Calculate P-value for Johansen Statistics. // Directly extract
		and plot stochastic common trends from a cointegration system
		using different approaches, currently including Kasa (1992) and
		Gonzalo and Granger (1995). The approach proposed by Gonzalo
		and Granger, also known as Permanent-Transitory Decomposition,
		is widely used in macroeconomics and market microstructure
		literature. Kasa's approach, on the other hand, has a nice
		property that it only uses the super consistent estimator: the
		cointegration vector 'beta'. This package also provides
		functions calculate P-value from Johansen Statistics according
		to the approximation method proposed by Doornik (1998). Update:
		0.7-1: Fix bugs in calculation alpha. Add formulas and more
		explanations. 0.6-1: Rewrite the description file. 0.5-1: Add
		functions to calculate P-value from Johansen statistic, and
		vice versa.
