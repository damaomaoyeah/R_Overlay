		Conjoint Analysis through Averaging of Multiple Analyses // The
		package aids in creating a Conjoint Analysis design with extra
		cards.  Unlike traditional "holdout" cards these cards are used
		to create a set of "good" (balanced and low correlation)
		designs. Each of these designs is analyzed and the average
		calculated.
