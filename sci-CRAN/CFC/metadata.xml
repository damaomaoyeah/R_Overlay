		Cause-Specific Framework for Competing-Risk Analysis // Functions
		for combining survival curves of competing risks to produce
		cumulative incidence and event-free probability functions, and
		for summarizing and plotting the results. Survival curves can
		be either time-denominated or probability-denominated. Point
		estimates as well as Bayesian, sample-based representations of
		survival can utilize this framework.
