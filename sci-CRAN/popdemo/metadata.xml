		Provides Tools For Demographic Modelling Using Projection
		Matrices // popdemo provides a set of tools designed for
		modelling population demography using population projection
		matrix (PPM) models.  The focus is mainly on indices of
		transient dynamics, and the use of control theory (specifically
		transfer functions).  However, popdemo includes a number of
		tools focussing on other areas of demographic modelling.  Some
		tools may prove useful to anyone working with projection matrix
		models of any type, or indeed matrices in general. The package
		is designed to build on those tools already available in
		popbio.
