		Demographic Modelling Using Projection Matrices // Tools for
		modelling populations and demography using matrix projection
		models (MPMs). Designed to build on similar tools already
		available in 'popbio'. Specific foci are on indices of
		transient dynamics and use of control theory approaches, but
		'popdemo' may also be useful for other implementations of MPMs,
		or matrix models in a more general sense.
