		Open Perimetry Interface // Implementation of the Open Perimetry
		Interface (OPI) for simulating and controlling visual field
		machines using R. The OPI is a standard for interfacing with
		visual field testing machines (perimeters). It specifies basic
		functions that allow many visual field tests to be constructed.
		As of February 2015 it is fully implemented on the Octopus 600
		and Octopus 900 and partially on the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter
		and the Kowa AP 7000. It also has a cousin: the R package
		visualFields, which has tools for analysing and manipulating
		visual field data.
