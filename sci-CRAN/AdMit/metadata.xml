		Adaptive Mixture of Student-t distributions // This package
		provides functions to perform the fitting of an adaptive
		mixture of Student-t distributions to a target density through
		its kernel function. The mixture approximation can then be used
		as the importance density in importance sampling or as the
		candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to
		obtain quantities of interest for the target density itself.
