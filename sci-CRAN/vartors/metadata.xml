		Transform Definition of Variables to R Scripts // Generates R
		scripts useful to perform repetitive tasks on variables of
		different classes from a simple database. First it helps to
		create a tabular file describing the variables. Then the
		package could process this tabulate file to create a script in
		a .R or .Rmd format. This script will include code blocks for
		each variable according to the variable description. It could
		help to import, adapt to R classes and perform descriptive
		analysis on each variable according to its type. This R script
		could be used as it is or it could be modified if necessary to
		perform additional analysis. The user could write his own R
		script template to produce a customized script.
