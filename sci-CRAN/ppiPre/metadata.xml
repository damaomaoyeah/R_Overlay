		Predict protein-protein interactions based on functional and
		topological similarities. // This package implements several
		functions useful for computing similarities between proteins
		based on their GO annotation, KEGG annotation and PPI network
		topology. It integrates these similarities to predict PPIs
		using an SVM classifier. Twenty species are supported,
		including Anopheles, Arabidopsis, Bovine, Canine, Chicken,
		Chimp, E coli strain K12 and strain Sakai, Fly, Human, Malaria,
		Mouse, Pig, Rhesus, Rat, Worm, Xenopus, Yeast, Streptomyces
		coelicolor and Zebrafish.
