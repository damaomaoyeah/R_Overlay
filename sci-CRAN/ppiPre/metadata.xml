		Predict Protein-Protein Interactions Based on Functional and
		Topological Similarities // Computing similarities between
		proteins based on their GO annotation, KEGG annotation and PPI
		network topology. It integrates seven features (TCSS,
		IntelliGO, Wang, KEGG, Jaccard, RA and AA) to predict PPIs
		using an SVM classifier. Some internal functions to calculate
		GO semantic similarities are re-used from R package GOSemSim
		authored by Guangchuang Yu.
