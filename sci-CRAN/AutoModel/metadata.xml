		Checking // A set of functions that automates the process and
		produces reasonable output for hierarchical multiple regression
		models.  It allows you to specify predictor blocks, from which
		it generates all of the linear models, and checks the
		assumptions of the model, producing the requisite plots and
		statistics to allow you to judge the suitability of the model.
