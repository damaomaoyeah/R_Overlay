		OmicKriging for Phenotypic Prediction // This package provides
		functions to generate a correlation matrix from a genetic
		dataset and to use this matrix to predict the phenotype of an
		individual by using the phenotypes of the remaining individuals
		through kriging. Kriging is a geostatistical method for optimal
		prediction or best unbiased linear prediction. It consists of
		predicting the value of a variable at an unobserved location as
		a weighted sum of the variable at observed locations.
		Intuitively, it works as a reverse linear regression: instead
		of computing correlation (univariate regression coefficients
		are simply scaled correlation) between a dependent variable Y
		and independent variables X, it uses known correlation between
		X and Y to predict Y.
