		Analysing Conditional Income Distributions // Functions for the
		analysis of income distributions for subgroups of the
		population as defined by a set of variables like age, gender,
		region, etc. This entails a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for a
		mixture distribution as well as functions for moments,
		inequality measures, entropy measures and polarisation measures
		of income distributions. This package thus aides the analysis
		of income inequality by offering tools for the exploratory
		analysis of income distributions at the disaggregated level.
