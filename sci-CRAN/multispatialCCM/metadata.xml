		Multispatial Convergent Cross Mapping // The multispatial
		convergent cross mapping algorithm can be used as a test for
		causal associations between pairs of processes represented by
		time series. This is a combination of convergent cross mapping
		(CCM), described in Sugihara et al., 2012, Science, 338,
		496-500, and dew-drop regression, described in Hsieh et al.,
		2008, American Naturalist, 171, 7180. The algorithm allows CCM
		to be implemented on data that are not from a single long time
		series. Instead, data can come from many short time series,
		which are stitched together using bootstrapping.
