		R as a plotting engine // This package is intended for using R as
		a plotting engine either by custom applications, or from a
		small script launched from the system console, or even within
		the R console. Two ASCII text files are necessary: (1) The
		graph parameters file, which name is passed to the function
		'rplotengine()'. The user can specify the titles, choose the
		type of the graph, graph output formats (e.g. png, eps),
		proportion of the X-axis and Y-axis, position of the legend,
		whether to show or not a grid at the background, etc. (2) The
		data to be plotted, which name is specified as a parameter
		('data_filename') in the previous file. This data file has a
		tabulated format, with a single character (e.g. tab) between
		each column, and a headers line located in the first row.
		Optionally, the file could include data columns for showing
		confidence intervals.
