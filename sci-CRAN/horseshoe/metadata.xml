		Implementation of the Horseshoe Prior // Contains functions for
		applying the horseshoe prior to high- dimensional linear
		regression, yielding the posterior mean and credible intervals,
		amongst other things. The key parameter tau can be equipped
		with a prior or estimated via maximum marginal likelihood
		estimation (MMLE). The main function, horseshoe, is for linear
		regression. In addition, there are functions specifically for
		the sparse normal means problem, allowing for faster
		computation of for example the posterior mean and posterior
		variance. Finally, there is a function available to perform
		variable selection, using either a form of thresholding, or
		credible intervals.
