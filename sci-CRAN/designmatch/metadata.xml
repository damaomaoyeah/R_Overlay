		Construction of Optimally Matched Samples for Randomized
		Experiments and Observational Studies that are Balanced by
		Design // Includes functions for the construction of matched
		samples that are balanced by design.  These functions include
		options for directly balancing means, higher order moments and
		distributions of the covariates, that can be used in
		observational studies with treatment and control units, cases
		and controls, and more generally in settings with instrumental
		variables and in discontinuity designs.  These functions can
		also be used for the design of randomized experiments, for
		example for matching before randomization.  The performance of
		these functions is greatly enhanced by the Gurobi optimization
		solver and its associated R interface.  For their installation,
		please follow the instructions at
		http://user.gurobi.com/download/gurobi-optimizer and http://www
		.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/refman/r_api_overview.html; also,
		we have included direction in the gurobi_installation file in
		the inst folder.
