		Construction of Optimally Matched Samples for Randomized
		Experiments and Observational Studies that are Balanced by
		Design // Includes functions for the construction of matched
		samples that are balanced by design.  Among others, these
		functions can be used for matching in observational studies
		with treated and control units, with cases and controls, in
		related settings with instrumental variables, and in
		discontinuity designs.  Also, they can be used for the design
		of randomized experiments, for example, for matching before
		randomization.  By default, 'designmatch' uses the 'GLPK'
		optimization solver, but its performance is greatly enhanced by
		the 'Gurobi' optimization solver and its associated R
		interface.  For their installation, please follow the
		instructions at http://user.gurobi.com/download/gurobi-
		optimizer and http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/6.5/refman/r_
		api_overview.html.  We have also included directions in the
		gurobi_installation file in the inst folder.
