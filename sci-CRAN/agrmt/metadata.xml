		Calculate Agreement or Consensus in Ordered Rating Scales //
		Calculate agreement or consensus in ordered rating scales. The
		package implements van der Eijk's (2001) measure of agreement
		A, which can be used to describe agreement, consensus, or
		polarization among respondents. It also implements measures of
		consensus (dispersion) by Leik, Tatsle and Wierman, Blair and
		Lacy, Kvalseth, Berry and Mielke, and Garcia-Montalvo and
		Reynal-Querol. Furthermore, an implementation of Galtungs AJUS-
		system is provided to classify distributions, as well as a
		function to identify the position of multiple modes.
