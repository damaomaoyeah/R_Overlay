		Poisson Log-linear Models with Spatio-temporal Random Effects //
		Implements a series of Poisson log-linear models with spatio-
		temporal random effects. The spatial and temporal
		autocorrelation in the random effects are induced using the
		class of Conditional AutoRegressive (CAR) priors, which are a
		special case of Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF). All
		models are fitted in a Bayesian context using Markov chain
		Monte Carlo (McMC) simulation.
