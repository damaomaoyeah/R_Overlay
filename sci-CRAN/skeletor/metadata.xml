		An R Package Skeleton Generator // A tool for bootstrapping new
		packages with useful defaults, including a test suite outline
		that passes checks and helpers for running tests, checking test
		coverage, building vignettes, and more. Package skeletons it
		creates are set up for pushing your package to 'GitHub' and
		using other hosted services for building and test automation.
