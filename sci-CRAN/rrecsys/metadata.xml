		Environment for Assessing Recommender Systems // Provides
		implementations of several popular recommendation systems. They
		can process standard recommendation datasets (user/item matrix)
		as input and generate rating predictions and recommendation
		lists.  Standard algorithm implementations included in this
		package are: Global/Item/User-Average baselines, Item-Based
		KNN, FunkSVD, BPR and weighted ALS. They can be assessed
		according to the standard offline evaluation methodology for
		recommender systems using measures such as MAE, RMSE,
		Precision, Recall, AUC, NDCG, RankScore and coverage measures.
		The package is intended for rapid prototyping of recommendation
		algorithms and education purposes.
