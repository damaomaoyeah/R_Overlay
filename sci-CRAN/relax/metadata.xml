		relax -- R Editor for Literate Analysis and lateX // package
		relax contains some functions for report writing, presentation,
		and programming: relax(), tangleR(), weaveR(), (g)slider().
		"relax" is written in R and Tcl/Tk. relax creates a new window
		(top level Tcl/Tk widget) that consists of two text fields and
		some buttons and menus. Text (chunks) and code (chunks) are
		inserted in the upper text field (report field). Code chunks
		are evaluated by clicking on EvalRCode. Results are shown in
		the lower text field (output field) and will be transferred to
		the report field by pressing on Insert. In this way you get
		correct reports. These reports can be loaded again in cause of
		presentation, modification and result checking. tangleR() and
		weaveR() implement a plain kind of tangling and weaving.
		gslider() and slider() are designed to define sliders for
		interactive experiments in a simple way. The syntax rules of
		code chunks and text chunks are defined by the noweb system
		proposed by Norman Ramsey
		(http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/intro.html).
