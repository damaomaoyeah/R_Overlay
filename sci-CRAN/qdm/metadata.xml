		Fitting a Quadrilateral Dissimilarity Model to Same-Different
		Judgments // This package provides different specifications of
		a Quadrilateral Dissimilarity Model which can be used to fit
		same-different judgments in order to get a predicted matrix
		that satisfies regular minimality [Colonius  Dzhafarov, 2006,
		Measurement and representations of sensations, Erlbaum]. From
		such a matrix, Fechnerian distances can be computed.
