		ABC Extremes // This package contains code to 1.) construct the
		summary statistic needed to facilitate approximate Bayesian
		computing for spatial extremes, and then 2.) run the ABC-
		Rejection method to produce a set of draws from the ABC
		posterior.  The intention is for the user to directly modify
		the command abc.rej() to suit his or her purposes.  In general,
		ABC fitting of max-stable processes is very computationally
		expensive, and requires advanced programming skills with
		research computing.
