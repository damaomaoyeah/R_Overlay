		Model diagnostics for population pharmacokinetic models //
		PKgraph provides a graphical user interface for population
		pharmacokinetic model diagnosis. It also provides an integrated
		and comprehensive platform for the analysis of pharmacokinetic
		data including exploratory data analysis, goodness of model
		fit, model validation and model comparison. Results from a
		variety of modeling fitting software, including NONMEM,
		Monolix, SAS and R, can be used. PKgraph is programmed in R,
		and uses the R packages lattice, ggplot2 for static graphics,
		and rggobi for interactive graphics.
