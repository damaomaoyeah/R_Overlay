		R6 Objects for Text and Data // For natural language processing
		and analysis of qualitative text coding structures which
		provide a way to bind together text and text data are
		fundamental. The package provides such a structure and
		accompanying methods in form of R6 objects. The 'rtext' class
		allows for text handling and text coding (character or regex
		based) including data updates on text transformations as well
		as aggregation on various levels. Furthermore, the usage of R6
		enables inheritance and passing by reference which should
		enable 'rtext' instances to be used as back-end for R based
		graphical text editors or text coding GUIs.
