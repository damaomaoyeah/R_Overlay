		Covariance Matrix Estimation // We implement a collection of
		techniques for estimating covariance matrices. Covariance
		matrices can be built using missing data. Stambaugh Estimation
		and FMMC methods can be used to construct such matrices.
		Covariance matrices can be built by denoising or shrinking the
		eigenvalues of a sample covariance matrix. Such techniques work
		by exploiting the tools in Random Matrix Theory to analyse the
		distribution of eigenvalues. Covariance matrices can also be
		built assuming that data has many underlying regimes. Each
		regime is allowed to follow a Dynamic Conditional Correlation
		model. Robust covariance matrices can be constructed by
		multivariate cleaning and smoothing of noisy data.
