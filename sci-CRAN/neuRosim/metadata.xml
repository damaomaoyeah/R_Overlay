		Functions to Generate fMRI Data Including Activated Data, Noise
		Data and Resting State Data // The package allows users to
		generate fMRI time series or 4D data. Some high-level functions
		are created for fast data generation with only a few arguments
		and a diversity of functions to define activation and noise.
		For more advanced users it is possible to use the low-level
		functions and manipulate the arguments.
