		XHMM R scripts // R scripts for plotting and assessing XHMM
		whole-exome-sequencing-based CNV calls. XHMM (eXome Hidden
		Markov Model) is a C++ software package
		(http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/xhmm) written to call copy number
		variation (CNV) from next-generation sequencing projects, where
		exome capture was used (or targeted sequencing, more
		generally). This R package enables the user to visualize both
		the PCA normalization performed by XHMM and the CNVs it has
		called.
