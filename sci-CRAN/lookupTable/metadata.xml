		with the mean or median values of observations fall in
		partitions of the feature space. Partitions can be determined
		by user of the package using input argument feature.boundaries,
		and dimensions of the feature space can be any combination of
		continuous and categorical features provided by the data set. A
		Predict function directly fetches corresponding entry value,
		and a default value is defined as the mean or median of all
		available observations. The table and other components are
