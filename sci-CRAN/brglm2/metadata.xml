		Bias Reduction in Generalized Linear Models // Estimation and
		inference from generalized linear models based on various
		methods for bias reduction. The brglmFit fitting method can
		achieve reduction of estimation bias either through the
		adjusted score equations approach in Firth (1993)
		https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/80.1.27 and Kosmidis and Firth
		(2009) https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asp055, or through the
		direct subtraction of an estimate of the bias of the maximum
		likelihood estimator from the maximum likelihood estimates as
		in Cordeiro and McCullagh (1991)
		http://www.jstor.org/stable/2345592. In the special case of
		generalized linear models for binomial and multinomial
		responses, the adjusted score equations approach returns
		estimates with improved frequentist properties, that are also
		always finite, even in cases where the maximum likelihood
		estimates are infinite (e.g. complete and quasi-complete
		separation). Estimation in all cases takes place via a quasi
		Fisher scoring algorithm, and S3 methods for the construction
		of of confidence intervals for the reduced-bias estimates are
		provided.
