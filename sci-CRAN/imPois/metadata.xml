		Imprecise Inferential Framework for Poisson Sampling Model // A
		collection of tools for conducting an imprecise inference is
		provided.   Imprecise prior is used for this inference, and
		imprecise probability theory introduced by Peter Walley (1991)
		is its underlying theoretical foundation.   The package is
		developed based on the PhD thesis work of Lee (2014).  Poisson
		and zero-truncated Poisson sampling models are mainly studied
		with two types of prior distributions.
