		Paired Comparison Data Analysis // Different tools for describing
		and analysing paired comparison data are presented. Main
		methods are estimation of products scores according Bradley
		Terry Luce model. A segmentation of the individual could be
		conducted on the basis of a mixture distribution approach. The
		number of classes can be tested by the use of Monte Carlo
		simulations. This package deals also with multi-criteria paired
		comparison data.
