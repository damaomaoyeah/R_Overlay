		Extract Equations from a Nomogram // A nomogram can not be easily
		applied, because it is difficult to calculate the points or
		even the survival probability. The package, including a
		function of nomogramEx(), is to extract the polynomial
		equations to calculate the points of each variable, and the
		survival probability corresponding to the total points.
