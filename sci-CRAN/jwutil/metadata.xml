		Utilities for Data Manipulation, Disk Caching, Testing // This is
		a set of simple utilities for various data manipulation and
		caching tasks. The goal is to use base tools well, without
		bringing in any dependencies. Main areas of interest are data
		frame manipulation, such as converting factors in multiple
		binary indicator columns, and disk caching of data frames
		(which is optionally done by date range). There are testing
		functions which provide testthat expectations to permute
		arguments to function calls. There are functions and data to
		test extreme numbers, dates, and bad input of various kinds
		which should allow testing failure and corner cases. The test
		suite has many examples of usage.
