		SOD for multidimensional scaling. // SOD (Self-Organising-
		Deltoids) provides multidimensional scaling by gradually
		reducing the dimensionality of an initial space and using the
		resulting stress in the configuration to re-arrange nodes.
		Stress is calculated from the errors in the inter-node
		distances, and the sum of the stresses at each node is combined
		to create N-dimensional force vectors that direct the movement
		of nodes as the dimensionality is iteratively reduced.
