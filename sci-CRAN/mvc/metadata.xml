		Multi-View Clustering // An implementation of Multi-View
		Clustering (Bickel and Scheffer, 2004). Documents are generated
		by drawing word values from a categorical distribution for each
		word, given the cluster. This means words are not counted
		(multinomial, as in the paper), but words take on different
		values from a finite set of values (categorical). Thus, it
		implements Mixture of Categoricals EM (as opposed to Mixture of
		Multinomials developed in the paper), and Spherical k-Means.
		The latter represents documents as vectors in the categorical
		space.
