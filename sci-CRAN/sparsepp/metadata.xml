		'Rcpp' Interface to 'sparsepp' // Provides interface to
		'sparsepp' - fast, memory efficient hash map. It is derived
		from Google's excellent 'sparsehash' implementation. We believe
		'sparsepp' provides an unparalleled combination of performance
		and memory usage, and will outperform your compiler's
		unordered_map on both counts. Only Google's 'dense_hash_map' is
		consistently faster, at the cost of much greater memory usage
		(especially when the final size of the map is not known in
		advance).
