		Visualization of Multivariate Functions, Sets, and Data // We
		provide tools to (1) visualize multivariate density functions
		and density estimates with level set trees, (2) visualize level
		sets with shape trees, (3) visualize multivariate data with
		tail trees, (4) visualize scales of multivariate density
		estimates with mode graphs and branching maps, and (5)
		visualize anisotropic spread with 2D volume functions and 2D
		probability content functions. Level set trees visualize mode
		structure, shape trees visualize shapes of level sets of
		unimodal densities, and tail trees visualize connected data
		sets. The kernel estimator is implemented but the package may
		also be applied for visualizing other density estimates.
