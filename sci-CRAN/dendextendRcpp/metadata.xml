		Faster Dendrogram Manipulation using 'Rcpp' // Offers faster
		manipulation of dendrogram objects in R. A dendrogram object in
		R is a list structure with attributes in its nodes and leaves.
		Working with dendrogram objects often require a function to
		recursively go through all (or most) element in the list
		object. Naturally, such function are rather slow in R, but can
		become much faster thanks to 'Rcpp'.
