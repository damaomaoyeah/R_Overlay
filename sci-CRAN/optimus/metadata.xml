		Model Based Diagnostics for Multivariate Cluster Analysis //
		Assessment and diagnostics for comparing competing clustering
		solutions, using predictive models. The main intended use is
		for comparing clustering/classification solutions of ecological
		data (e.g. presence/absence, counts, ordinal scores) to 1) find
		an optimal partitioning solution, 2) identify characteristic
		species and 3) refine a classification by merging clusters that
		increase predictive performance. However, in a more general
		sense, this package can do the above for any set of clustering
		solutions for i observations of j variables.
