		Haplotype Inference and Statistical Analysis of Genetic Variation
		// Provides S4 classes and methods for reading and manipulating
		aligned DNA sequences, supporting an indel coding methods (only
		simple indel coding method is available in the current
		version), showing base substitutions and indels, calculating
		absolute pairwise distances between DNA sequences, and
		inferring haplotypes from DNA sequences or user provided
		absolute character difference matrix.  This package also
		includes S4 classes and methods for estimating genealogical
		relationships among haplotypes using statistical parsimony.
