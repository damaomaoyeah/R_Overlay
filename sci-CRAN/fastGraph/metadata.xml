		Fast Drawing and Shading of Graphs of Statistical Distributions
		// Provides functionality to produce graphs of probability
		density functions and cumulative distribution functions with
		few keystrokes, allows shading under the curve of the
		probability density function to illustrate concepts such as
		p-values and critical values, and fits a simple linear
		regression line on a scatter plot with the equation as the main
		title.
