		Convert Categorical Representations of Logicals to Actual
		Logicals // Survey systems and other third-party data sources
		commonly use non-standard representations of logical values
		when it comes to qualitative data - "Yes", "No" and "N/A", say.
		batman is a package designed to seamlessly convert these into
		logicals. It is highly localised, and contains equivalents to
		boolean values in languages including German, French, Spanish,
		Italian, Turkish, Chinese and Polish.
