		Fast Multivariate Normal and Student's t Methods // Provides
		computationally efficient tools related to the multivariate
		normal and Student's t distributions. The main functionalities
		are: simulating multivariate random vectors, evaluating
		multivariate normal or Student's t densities and Mahalanobis
		distances. These tools are very efficient thanks to the use of
		C++ code and of the OpenMP API.
