		Computing optimal cutpoints in diagnostic tests // This package
		enables users to compute one or more optimal cutpoints for
		diagnostic tests or continuous markers. Various approaches for
		selecting optimal cutoffs have been implemented, including
		methods based on cost-benefit analysis and diagnostic test
		accuracy measures (Sensitivity/Specificity, Predictive Values
		and Diagnostic Likelihood Ratios). Numerical and graphical
		output for all methods is easily obtained.
