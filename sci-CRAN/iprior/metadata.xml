		Linear Regression using I-Priors // In a linear regression
		setting, priors can be assigned to the regression function
		using a vector space framework, and the posterior estimate of
		the regression function obtained. I-priors are a class of such
		priors based on the principle of maximum entropy. While the
		main interest of I-prior modelling is prediction, inference is
		also possible, e.g. via log-likelihood ratio tests. This
		package supports both formula and non-formula based input.
		Estimation is mainly done via an EM algorithm, but there is
		flexibility in using any R optimiser to maximise the log-
		likelihood computed by the kernel loader function.
