		Create American Psychological Association (APA) Style Tables // A
		common task faced by researchers is the creation of APA style
		(i.e., American Psychological Association style) tables from
		statistical output. In R a large number of function calls are
		often needed to obtain all of the desired information for a
		single APA style table. As well, the process of manually
		creating APA style tables in a word processor is prone to
		transcription errors. This package creates Word files (.doc
		files) containing APA style tables for several types of
		analyses. Using this package minimizes transcription errors and
		reduces the number commands needed by the user.
