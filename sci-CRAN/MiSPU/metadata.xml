		Microbiome Based Sum of Powered Score (MiSPU) Tests // There is
		an increasing interest in investigating how the compositions of
		microbial communities are associated with human health and
		disease. In this package, we present a novel global testing
		method called aMiSPU, that is highly adaptive and thus high
		powered across various scenarios, alleviating the issue with
		the choice of a phylogenetic distance. Our simulations and real
		data analysis demonstrated that aMiSPU test was often more
		powerful than several competing methods while correctly
		controlling type I error rates.
