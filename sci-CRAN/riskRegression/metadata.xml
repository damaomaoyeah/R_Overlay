		Risk Regression Models and Prediction Scores for Survival
		Analysis with Competing Risks // Implementation of the
		following methods for event history analysis. Risk regression
		models for survival endpoints also in the presence of competing
		risks are fitted using binomial regression based on a time
		sequence of binary event status variables. A formula interface
		for the Fine-Gray regression model and an interface for the
		combination of cause-specific Cox regression models. A toolbox
		for assessing and comparing performance of risk predictions
		(risk markers and risk prediction models). Prediction
		performance is measured by the Brier score and the area under
		the ROC curve for binary possibly time-dependent outcome.
		Inverse probability of censoring weighting and pseudo values
		are used to deal with right censored data. Lists of risk
		markers and lists of risk models are assessed simultaneously.
		Cross-validation repeatedly splits the data, trains the risk
		prediction models on one part of each split and then summarizes
		and compares the performance across splits.
