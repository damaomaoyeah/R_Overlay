		Harvest the Classification Tree // Aimed at applying the Harvest
		classification tree algorithm, modified algorithm of classic
		classification tree.The harvested tree has advantage of
		deleting redundant rules in trees, leading to a simplify and
		more efficient tree model.It was firstly used in drug discovery
		field, but it also performs well in other kinds of data,
		especially when the region of a class is disconnected. This
		package also improves the basic harvest classification tree
		algorithm by extending the field of data of algorithm to both
		continuous and categorical variables. To learn more about the
		harvest classification tree algorithm, you can go to
		http://www.stat.ubc.ca/Research/TechReports/techreports/220.pdf
		for more information.
