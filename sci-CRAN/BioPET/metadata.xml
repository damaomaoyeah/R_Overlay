		Biomarker Prognostic Enrichment Tool // Prognostic Enrichment is
		a clinical trial strategy of evaluating an intervention in a
		patient population with a higher rate of the unwanted event
		than the broader patient population (R. Temple (2010)
		DOI:10.1038/clpt.2010.233). This higher event rate translates
		to a lower sample size for the clinical trial, which can have
		both practical and ethical advantages. This package is a tool
		to help evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of
		clinical trials.
