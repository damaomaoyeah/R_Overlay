		competing risks regression, the proportional subdistribution
		hazards(PSH) model is popular for its direct assessment of
		covariate effects on the cumulative incidence function. This
		package allows for penalized variable selection for the PSH
		model. Penalties include LASSO, SCAD, MCP, and their group
		versions.
