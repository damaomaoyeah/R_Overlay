		Optimization Toolbox for solving linear systems // The optR
		function provides an option to solve the linear system using
		numeric computation approach. The current packages supports
		Gauss Elimination, LU decomposition, Gauss-Sideil, CGM and
		Cholesky methods to solve equations having relationships of
		Ax=b form. The package can be used to build linear and non-
		linear models by defining them in linear system.
