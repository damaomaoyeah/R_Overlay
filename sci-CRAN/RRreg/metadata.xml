		Correlation and Regression Analyses for Randomized Response Data
		// Univariate and multivariate methods to analyze randomized
		response (RR) survey designs (e.g., Warner, S. L. (1965).
		Randomized response: A survey technique for eliminating evasive
		answer bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association,
		60, 6369). doi:10.2307/2283137 Besides univariate estimates of
		true proportions, RR variables can be used for correlations, as
		dependent variable in a logistic regression (with or without
		random effects), as predictors in a linear regression, or as
		dependent variable in a beta-binomial ANOVA. For simulation and
		bootstrap purposes, RR data can be generated according to
		several models.
