		Basic R Interface to the FLANN C++ Library // Basic R interface
		for the FLANN C++ library written by Marius Muja and David
		Lowe. This package was written primarily for another package,
		'rcss'. This packages utilises a few features from the FLANN
		C++ library. When I have time (and if there is sufficient
		demand), I will add more functions.
