		Spatial Areal Unit Modelling // Implements a class of spatial
		generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with
		inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo
		(McMC) simulation. The spatial autocorrelation is modelled by
		a set of random effects, which are assigned a conditional
		autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of different
		CAR priors are available for the random effects, and full
		details are given in the vignette accompanying this package.
		The initial creation of this package was supported by the
		Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant
		RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development is supported by the
		Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant
		EP/J017442/1.
