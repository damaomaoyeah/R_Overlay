		Spatial Generalised Linear Mixed Models for Areal Unit Data //
		Implements a class of spatial generalised linear mixed models
		for areal unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using
		Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) simulation. The response
		variable can be binomial, Gaussian or Poisson. The spatial
		autocorrelation is modelled by  a set of random effects, which
		are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior
		distribution. A number of different CAR priors are available
		for the random effects, and full details are given in the
		vignette accompanying this package. The initial creation of
		this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research
		Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development
		is supported by the Engineering and Physical Science Research
		Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1.
