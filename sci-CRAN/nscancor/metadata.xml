		Non-Negative and Sparse CCA // This package implements two
		algorithms for canonical correlation analysis (CCA) that are
		based on iterated regression steps. By choosing the appropriate
		regression algorithm for each data modality, it is possible to
		enforce sparsity, non-negativity or other kinds of constraints
		on the projection vectors. Multiple canonical variables are
		computed sequentially using a generalized deflation scheme,
		where the additional correlation not explained by previous
		variables is maximized. 'nscancor' is used to analyze paired
		data from two domains, and has the same interface as the
		'cancor' function from the 'stats' package (plus some extra
		parameters). 'mcancor' is appropriate for analyzing data from
		three or more domains.
