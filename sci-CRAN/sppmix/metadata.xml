		Modeling Spatial Poisson and Related Point Processes //
		Implements classes and methods for modeling spatial point
		patterns using inhomogeneous Poisson point processes, where the
		intensity surface is assumed to be analogous to a finite
		additive mixture of normal components and the number of
		components is a finite, fixed or random integer. Extensions to
		the marked inhomogeneous Poisson point processes case are also
		presented. We provide an extensive suite of R functions that
		can be used to simulate, visualize and model point patterns,
		estimate the parameters of the models, assess convergence of
		the algorithms and perform model selection and checking in the
		proposed modeling context.
