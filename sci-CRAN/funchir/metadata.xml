		Convenience Functions by Michael Chirico // A set of functions,
		some subset of which I use in every .R file I write. Examples
		are table2(), which adds useful functionalities to base table
		(sorting, built-in proportion argument, etc.); lyx.xtable(),
		which converts xtable() output to a format more easily copy-
		pasted into LyX; pdf2(), which writes a plot to file while also
		displaying it in the RStudio plot window; and
		abbr_to_colClass(), which is a much more concise way of feeding
		many types to a colClass argument in a data reader.
