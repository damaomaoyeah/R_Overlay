		Matrix Analysis and Normalization by Concordant Information
		Enhancement // High-dimensional data integration is a critical
		but difficult problem in genomics research because of potential
		biases from high-throughput experiments. We present MANCIE, a
		computational method for integrating two genomic data sets with
		homogenous dimensions from different sources based on a PCA
		procedure as an approximation to a Bayesian approach.
