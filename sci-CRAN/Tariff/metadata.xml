		Replicate Tariff Method for Verbal Autopsy // Implement the
		Tariff algorithm for coding cause-of-death from verbal
		autopsies. The Tariff method was originally proposed in James
		et al (2011) DOI:10.1186/1478-7954-9-31 and later refined as
		Tariff 2.0 in Serina, et al. (2015)
		DOI:10.1186/s12916-015-0527-9. Note that this package was not
		developed by authors affiliated with the Institute for Health
		Metrics and Evaluation and thus unintentional discrepancies may
		exist between the this implementation and the implementation
		available from IHME.
