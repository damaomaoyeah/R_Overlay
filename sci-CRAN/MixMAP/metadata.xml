		Implements the MixMAP algorithm // This function implements the
		MixMAP algorithm, which performs gene level tests of
		association using data from a previous GWAS or data from a
		meta-analysis of several GWAS.  Conceptually, genes are
		detected as significant if the collection of p-values within a
		gene are determined to be collectively smaller than would be
		observed by chance.
