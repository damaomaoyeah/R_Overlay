		Social Relation Model (SRM) Analyses for Single or Multiple
		Groups // Social Relation Model (SRM) analyses for single or
		multiple round-robin groups are performed. These analyses are
		either based on one manifest variable, one latent construct
		measured by two manifest variables, two manifest variables and
		their bivariate relations, or two latent constructs each
		measured by two manifest variables. Within-group t-tests for
		variance components and covariances are provided for single
		groups, between-groups t-tests for multiple groups. Handling
		for missing values is provided.
