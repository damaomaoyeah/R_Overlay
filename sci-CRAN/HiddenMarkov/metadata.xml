		Hidden Markov Models // Contains functions for the analysis of
		Discrete Time Hidden Markov Models, Markov Modulated GLMs and
		the Markov Modulated Poisson Process. It includes functions for
		simulation, parameter estimation, and the Viterbi algorithm.
		See the topic "HiddenMarkov" for an introduction to the
		package, and "Change Log" for a list of recent changes. The
		algorithms are based of those of Walter Zucchini.
