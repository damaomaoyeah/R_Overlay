		Simulate Probabilistic Long-Term Effects in Models with Temporal
		Dependence // Calculates and depicts probabilistic long-term
		effects in binary models with temporal dependence variables.
		The package performs two tasks. First, it calculates the change
		in the probability of the event occurring given a change in a
		theoretical variable. Second, it calculates the rolling
		difference in the future probability of the event for two
		scenarios: one where the event occurred at a given time and one
		where the event does not occur. The package is consistent with
		the recent movement to depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret
		quantities of interest with the requisite measures of
		uncertainty. It is the first to make it easy for researchers to
		interpret short- and long-term effects of explanatory variables
		in binary autoregressive models, which can have important
		implications for the correct interpretation of these models.
