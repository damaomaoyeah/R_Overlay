		An R Interface to SOLAR // SOLAR is the standard software program
		to perform linkage and association mappings of the quantitative
		trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and
		complexity. This package allows the user to exploit the
		variance component methods implemented in SOLAR. It automates
		such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype
		data. It also parses the model output and contains summary and
		plotting functions for exploration of the results. In addition,
		solarius enables parallel computing of the linkage and
		association analyses, that makes the calculation of genome-wide
		scans more efficient. See http://solar.txbiomedgenetics.org/
		for more information about SOLAR.
