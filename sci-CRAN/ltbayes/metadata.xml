		Simulation-Based Bayesian Inference for Latent Traits of Item
		Response Models // Functions for simulating realizations from
		the posterior distribution of a latent trait of an item
		response model. Distributions are conditional on one or a
		subset of response patterns (e.g., sum scores). Functions for
		computing likelihoods, Fisher and observed information,
		posterior modes, and profile likelihood confidence intervals
		are also included. These functions are designed to be easily
		amenable to user-specified models.
