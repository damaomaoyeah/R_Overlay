		Calibrates and Reweights Units in Samples // Provides user-
		friendly tools for calibration in survey sampling. The package
		is production-oriented, and its interface is inspired by the
		famous popular macro 'Calmar' for SAS, so that 'Calmar' users
		can quickly get used to 'icarus'. In addition to calibration
		(with linear, raking and logit methods), 'icarus' features
		functions for calibration on tight bounds and penalized
		calibration.
