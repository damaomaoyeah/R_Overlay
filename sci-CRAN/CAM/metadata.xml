		Causal Additive Model (CAM) // The code takes an n x p data
		matrix and fits a Causal Additive Model (CAM) for estimating
		the causal structure of the underlying process. The output is a
		p x p adjacency matrix (a one in entry (i,j) indicates an edge
		from i to j). Details of the algorithm can be found in: P.
		Bhlmann, J. Peters, J. Ernest: "CAM: Causal Additive Models,
		high-dimensional order search and penalized regression", Annals
		of Statistics 42:2526-2556, 2014.
