		Inference in Logistic Regression // A permutation test is used
		for inference in logistic regression.  The procedure is useful
		when parameter estimates in ordinary logistic regression fail
		to converge or are unreliable due to small sample size, or when
		the conditioning in exact conditional logistic regression
		restricts the sample space too severely.
