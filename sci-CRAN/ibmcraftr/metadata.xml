		Toolkits to Develop Individual-Based Models in Infectious Disease
		// It provides a generic set of tools for initializing a
		synthetic population with each individual in specific disease
		states, and making transitions between those disease states
		according to the rates calculated on each timestep. The new
		version 1.0.0 has C++ code integration to make the functions
		run faster. It has also a higher level function to actually run
		the transitions for the number of timesteps that users specify.
		Additional functions will follow for changing attributes on
		demographic, health belief and movement.
