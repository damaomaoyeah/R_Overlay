		Multiple Hypothesis Testing for Variable Selection in High-
		Dimensional Linear Models // Multiple Hypothesis Testing For
		Variable Selection in high dimensional linear models. This
		package performs variable selection with multiple hypothesis
		testing, either for ordered variable selection or non-ordered
		variable selection. In both cases, a sequential procedure is
		performed. It starts to test the null hypothesis "no variable
		is relevant"; if this hypothesis is rejected, it then tests
		"only the first variable is relevant", and so on until the null
		hypothesis is accepted.
