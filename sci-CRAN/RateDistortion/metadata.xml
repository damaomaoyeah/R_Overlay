		Routines for Solving Rate-Distortion Problems // An
		implementation of routines for solving rate-distortion
		problems. Rate-distortion theory is a field within information
		theory that examines optimal lossy compression. That is, given
		that some information must be lost, how can a communication
		channel be designed that minimizes the cost of communication
		error? Rate-distortion theory is concerned with the optimal
		(minimal cost) solution to such tradeoffs. An important tool
		for solving rate-distortion problems is the Blahut algorithm,
		developed by Richard Blahut and described in: . Blahut, R. E.
		(1972). Computation of channel capacity and rate-distortion
		functions. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, IT-18(4),
		460-473. . This package implements the basic Blahut algorithm,
		and additionally contains a number of `helper' functions,
		including a routine for searching for an information channel
		that minimizes cost subject to a constraint on information
		rate.
