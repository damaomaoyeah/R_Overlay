		Thresholded variable selection and prediction based on estimating
		equations // This package implements a thresholded version of
		the EEBoost algorithm described in [Wolfson (2011, JASA)].
		EEBoost is a general-purpose method for variable selection
		which can be applied whenever inference would be based on an
		estimating equation. The package currently implements variable
		selection based on the Generalized Estimating Equations, but
		can also accommodate user-provided estimating functions.
		Thresholded EEBoost is a generalization which allows multiple
		variables to enter the model at each boosting step.
