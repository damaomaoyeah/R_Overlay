		Latent Semantic Analysis // The basic idea of latent semantic
		analysis (LSA) is, that text do have a higher order (=latent
		semantic) structure which, however, is obscured by word usage
		(e.g. through the use of synonyms or polysemy). By using
		conceptual indices that are derived statistically via a
		truncated singular value decomposition (a two-mode factor
		analysis) over a given document-term matrix, this variability
		problem can be overcome.
