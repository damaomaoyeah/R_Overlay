		Bayesian Sparse Factor Analysis model for the inference of
		pathways responsive to drug treatment // This method tries to
		explain the gene-wise treatment response ratios in terms of the
		latent pathways. It uses bayesian sparse factor modeling to
		infer the loadings (weights) of each pathway on its associated
		probesets as well as the latent factor activity levels for each
		treatment.
