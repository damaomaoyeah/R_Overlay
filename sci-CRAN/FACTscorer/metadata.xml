		Scores the FACT and FACIT Family of Patient-Reported Outcome
		Measures // Provides functions to score the Functional
		Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) and Functional Assessment
		of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) family of patient-reported
		outcome (PRO) measures.  The questionnaires themselves can be
		downloaded from www.FACIT.org.  For most of the FACIT
		questionnaires, FACIT.org provides scoring syntax for use with
		commercial statistical software (SAS and SPSS).  The FACTscorer
		R package is intended to serve as a free, reliable alternative
		for those without access to SAS or SPSS.  Additionally, it will
		allow R users to both score and analyze the FACT and FACIT
		scales in R, avoiding the time-consuming and and error-prone
		process of transferring data back-and-forth between statistical
		software. Finally, use of the FACTscorer package will prevent
		many sources of scoring error common when using SAS and/or SPSS
		syntax (e.g., copy-paste errors and other accidental
		modifications to the syntax).
