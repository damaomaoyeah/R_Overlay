		Persist Object Attributes Across Data Operations // In base R,
		object attributes are lost when objects are modified by common
		data operations such as subset, filter, slice, append, extract
		etc. This packages allows objects to be marked as 'sticky' and
		have resilient attributes that persist during these operations
		or when inserted into or extracted from recursive (i.e. list-or
		table-like) objects.
