		Monte Carlo hypothesis tests with Sequential Stopping // The
		package performs Monte Carlo hypothesis tests. It allows a
		couple of different sequential stopping boundaries (a truncated
		sequential probability ratio test boundary and a boundary
		proposed by Besag and Clifford, 1991). Gives valid p-values and
		confidence intervals on p-values.
