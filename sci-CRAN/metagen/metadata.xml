		Inference in Meta Analysis and Meta Regression // Provides
		methods for making inference in the random effects meta
		regression model such as point estimates and confidence
		intervals for the heterogeneity parameter and the regression
		coefficients vector.  Inference methods are based on different
		approaches to statistical inference. Methods from three
		different schools are included: methods based on the method of
		moments approach, methods based on likelihood, and methods
		based on generalised inference.  The package also includes
		tools to run extensive simulation studies in parallel on high
		performance clusters in a modular way.  This allows extensive
		testing of custom inferential methods with all implemented
		state-of-the-art methods in a standardised way.  Tools for
		evaluating the performance of both point and interval estimates
		are provided.  Also, a large collection of different pre-
		defined plotting functions is implemented in a ready-to-use
		fashion.
