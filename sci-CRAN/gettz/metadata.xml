		Get the Timezone Information // A function to retrieve the system
		timezone on Unix systems which has been found to find an answer
		when 'Sys.timezone()' has failed. It is based on an answer by
		Duane McCully posted on 'StackOverflow', and adapted to be
		callable from R. The package also builds on Windows, but just
		returns NULL.
