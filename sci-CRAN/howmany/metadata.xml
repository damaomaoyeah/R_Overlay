		A lower bound for the number of correct rejections // When
		testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, this package
		provides functionality to calculate a lower bound for the
		number of correct rejections (as a function of the number of
		rejected hypotheses), which holds simultaneously -with high
		probability- for all possible number of rejections.  As a
		special case, a lower bound for the total number of false null
		hypotheses can be inferred.  Dependent test statistics can be
		handled for multiple tests of associations. For independent
		test statistics, it is sufficient to provide a list of
		p-values.
