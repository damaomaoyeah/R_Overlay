		Spectral Density Estimation and Comparison for Functional Time
		Series // Functions for estimating spectral density operator of
		functional time series (FTS) and comparing the spectral density
		operator of two functional time series, in a way that allows
		detection of differences of the spectral density operator in
		frequencies and along the curve length.
