		Censored Regression with Conditional Heteroscedasticity //
		Different approaches to censored or truncated regression with
		conditional heteroscedasticity are provided. First, continuous
		distributions can be used for the (right and/or left censored
		or truncated) response with separate linear predictors for the
		mean and variance. Second, cumulative link models for ordinal
		data (obtained by interval-censoring continuous data) can be
		employed for heteroscedastic extended logistic regression
		(HXLR). In the latter type of models, the intercepts depend on
		the thresholds that define the intervals.
