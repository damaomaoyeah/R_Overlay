		Point-Process Response Model for Optogenetics // Optogenetics is
		a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been
		genetically modified to allow stimulation by flashes of light.
		This package implements the methodological framework, Point-
		process Response model for Optogenetics (PRO), for analyzing
		data from these experiments.  This method provides explicit
		nonlinear transformations to link the flash point-process with
		the spiking point-process.  Such response functions can be used
		to provide important and interpretable scientific insights into
		the properties of the biophysical process that governs neural
		spiking in response to optogenetic stimulation.
