		Regression Estimation and Presentation // A collection of
		functions for ease of presentation and interpretation of
		regression analysis. These functions are used to produce the
		statistics lectures in http://pj.freefaculty.org/guides. There
		are functions to explore the effect (or lack thereof) from
		"mean centering," "residual centering", and standardization.
		The vignette "rockchalk" offers a fairly comprehensive
		overview. The vignette "Rstyle" has advice about coding in R.
		See the outreg function for a convenient way to generate
		regression models for reports. For nice, easy to use pictures,
		see plotSlopes, plotCurves, plotPlane. The package title
		"rockchalk" refers to our school motto, "Rock Chalk Jayhawk, Go
		K.U.".
