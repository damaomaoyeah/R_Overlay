		Spatial Forecast Verification // Spatial forecast verification
		arose from verifying high-resolution forecasts, where coarser-
		resolution models generally are favored even when a human
		forecaster finds the higher-resolution model to be considerably
		better.  Most newly proposed methods, which largely come from
		image analysis, computer vision, and similar, are available,
		with more on the way.
