		Variable Selection in a Hierarchical Bayesian Model for a Hazard
		Function // Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival
		data using a Hierarchical Bayesian model with an Intrinsic
		Conditional Autoregressive formulation for the spatial
		dependency in the hazard rates for each piece. This function
		uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green MCMC to allow the number of
		split points to vary and also uses Stochastic Search Variable
		Selection to determine what covariates drive the risk of the
		event. This function outputs trace plots depicting the number
		of split points in the hazard and the number of variables
		included in the hazard. The function saves all posterior
		quantities to the desired path.
