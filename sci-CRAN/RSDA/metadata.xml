		R to Symbolic Data Analysis // Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) was
		proposed by professor Edwin Diday in 1987, the main purpose of
		SDA is to substitute the set of rows (cases) in the data table
		for  a concept (second order statistical unit). This package
		implements, to the symbolic case, certain techniques of
		automatic classification, as well as some linear models.
