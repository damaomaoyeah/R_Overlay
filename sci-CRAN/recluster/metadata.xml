		Ordination Methods for the Analysis of Beta-Diversity Indices //
		Beta-diversity indices provide dissimilarity matrices with
		particular distribution of data requiring specific treatment.
		For example the high frequency of ties and zero values in
		turnover indices produces hierarchical cluster dendrograms
		whose topology and bootstrap supports are affected by the order
		of rows in the original matrix. Moreover, biogeographical
		regionalization can be facilitated by a combination of
		hierarchical clustering and multi-dimensional scaling. The
		recluster package provides robust techniques to analyze pattern
		of similarity in species composition.
