		Post-Processing of the Markov Chain Simulated by ChronoModel //
		Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis and
		the post-processing of the Markov Chains simulated by
		ChronoModel (see http://www.chronomodel.fr for more
		information).  ChronoModel is a friendly software to construct
		a chronological model in a Bayesian framework.  Its output is
