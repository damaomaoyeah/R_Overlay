		Post-Processing of the Markov Chain Simulated by ChronoModel or
		Oxcal // Provides a list of functions for the statistical
		analysis and the post-processing of the Markov Chains simulated
		by ChronoModel (see http://www.chronomodel.fr for more
		information).  ChronoModel is a friendly software to construct
		a chronological model in a Bayesian framework.  Its output is
		a sampled Markov chain from the posterior distribution of dates
		component  the chronology. The functions can also be applied
		to the  analyse of mcmc output generated by Oxcal software.
