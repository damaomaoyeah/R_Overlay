		Bayesian Prediction of Stochastic Processes // Bayesian
		estimation and prediction for stochastic processes based on the
		Euler approximation. Considered processes are: jump diffusion,
		(mixed) diffusion models, hidden (mixed) diffusion models, non-
		homogeneous Poisson processes (NHPP), (mixed) regression models
		for comparison and a regression model including a NHPP.
