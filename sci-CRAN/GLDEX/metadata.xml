		Fitting Single and Mixture of Generalised Lambda Distributions
		(RS and FMKL) using Various Methods // The fitting algorithms
		considered in this package have two major objectives. One is to
		provide a smoothing device to fit distributions to data using
		the weight and unweighted discretised approach based on the bin
		width of the histogram. The other is to provide a definitive
		fit to the data set using the maximum likelihood and quantile
		matching estimation. Other methods such as moment matching,
		starship method, L moment matching are also provided.
		Diagnostics on goodness of fit can be done via qqplots, KS-
		resample tests and comparing mean, variance, skewness and
		kurtosis of the data with the fitted distribution.
