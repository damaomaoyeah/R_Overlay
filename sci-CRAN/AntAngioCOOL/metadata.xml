		Anti-Angiogenic Peptide Prediction // Machine learning based
		package to predict anti-angiogenic peptides using heterogeneous
		sequence descriptors. 'AntAngioCOOL' exploits five descriptor
		types of a peptide of interest to do prediction including:
		pseudo amino acid composition, k-mer composition, k-mer
		composition (reduced alphabet), physico-chemical profile and
		atomic profile. According to the obtained results,
		'AntAngioCOOL' reached to a satisfactory performance in anti-
		angiogenic peptide prediction on a benchmark non-redundant
		independent test dataset.
