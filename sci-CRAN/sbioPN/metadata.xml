		sbioPN: Simulation of deterministic and stochastic spatial
		biochemical reaction networks using Petri Nets // sbioPN is a
		package suited to perform simulation of deterministic and
		stochastic systems of biochemical reaction networks with
		spatial effects. Models are defined using a subset of Petri
		Nets, in a way that is close at how chemical reactions are
		defined. For deterministic solutions, sbioPN creates the
		associated system of differential equations "on the fly", and
		solves it with a Runge Kutta Dormand Prince 45 explicit
		algorithm. For stochastic solutions, sbioPN offers two variants
		of Gillespie algorithm, or SSA. For hybrid
		deterministic/stochastic, it employs the Haseltine and Rawlings
		algorithm, that partitions the system in fast and slow
		reactions. sbioPN algorithms are developed in C to achieve
		adequate performance.
