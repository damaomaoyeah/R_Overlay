		SOM Networks for Comparing Patterns with Peak Shifts // SOMs can
		be useful tools to group patterns containing several peaks. If
		peaks do not always occur at exactly the same position,
		classical distance measures cannot be used. This package
		provides SOM technology using the weighted crosscorrelation
		(WCC) distance.
