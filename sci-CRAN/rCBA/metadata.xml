		CBA Classifier for R // Provides implementations of rule pruning
		algorithms based on the "Classification Based on Associations"
		(CBA). It can be used for building classification models from
		association rules. Rules are pruned in the order of precedence
		given by the sort criteria and a default rule is added. CBA was
		originally proposed by Liu, B. Hsu, W. and Ma, Y (1998).
