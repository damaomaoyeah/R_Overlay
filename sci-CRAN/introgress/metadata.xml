		methods for analyzing introgression between divergent lineages //
		introgress provides functions for analyzing introgression of
		genotypes between divergent, hybridizing lineages, including
		estimating genomic clines from multi-locus genotype data and
		testing for deviations from neutral expectations. Functions are
		also provided for maximum likelihood estimation of molecular
		hybrid index and graphical analysis.
