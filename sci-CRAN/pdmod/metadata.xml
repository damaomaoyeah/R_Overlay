		Proximal/distal modeling framework for Pavlovian conditioning
		phenomena // This package provides a model of Pavlovian
		conditioning phenomena, such as response extinction and
		spontaneous recovery, and partial reinforcement extinction
		effects. Competing proximal and distal reward predictions,
		computed using fast and slow learning rates, combine according
		to their uncertainties and the recency of information. The
		resulting mean prediction drives the response rate.
