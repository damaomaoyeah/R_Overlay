		Fast access to large ASCII files // Methods for fast access to
		large ASCII files.  Currently the following file formats are
		supported: comma separated format (csv) and fixed width format.
		It is assumed that the files are too large to fit into memory,
		although the package can also be used to efficiently access
		files that do fit into memory. Methods are provided to access
		and process files blockwise. Furthermore, an opened file can be
		accessed as one would an ordinary data.frame. The LaF vignette
		gives an overview of the functionality provided.
