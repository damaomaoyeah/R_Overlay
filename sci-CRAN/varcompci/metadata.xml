		VARCOMPCI: A Package for Computation of Confidence Intervals for
		Variance Components of Mixed Models in R. // This package
		compute confidence intervals on individual variances for any
		balanced mixed model, involving five or fewer factors according
		to Burdick and Graybill (1992) methodology. The package would
		fit a saturated model to the data (main effect and interaction
		terms of all orders) providing an ANOVA model with Expected
		Mean Squares (type III) by using the (Bennett and Franklin
		1954) algorithm. The output will include: a table showing the
		confidence interval (CI) and estimate of each covariance
		parameter, as well as the method used to compute the CI, the
		Expected Mean Square, an ANOVA table showing the degrees of
		freedom (df), sums of squares (SS), mean squares (MS), F
		statistic, and finally AIC and BIC measures.
