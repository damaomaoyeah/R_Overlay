		Fractional Factorial designs with 2-level factors // This package
		creates regular and non-regular Fractional Factorial designs.
		Furthermore, analysis tools for Fractional Factorial designs
		with 2-level factors are offered (main effects and interaction
		plots for all factors simultaneously, cube plot for looking at
		the simultaneous effects of three factors, full or half normal
		plot, alias structure in a more readable format than with the
		built-in function alias). The package is still under
		development. While much of the intended functionality is
		already available, some changes and improvements are still to
		be expected. Suggestions are welcome.
