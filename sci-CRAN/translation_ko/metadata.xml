		R Manuals Literally Translated in Korean // R  version 2.1.0 and
		later support Korean translations of program messages.  The
		continuous efforts have been made by
		http://developer.r-project.org/TranslationTeams.html   The R
		Documentation files are licensed under the General Public
		License, version 2 or 3.   This means that the pilot project to
		translate them into Korean has permission to reproduce them and
		translate them.  This work is done with GNU 'gettext'
		utilities.  The portable object template is updated a weekly
		basis or whenever changes are necessary.  Comments and
		corrections via email to the maintainer is of course most
		welcome.   In order to voluntarily participate in or offer your
		help with this translation, please contact the maintainer.   To
		check the change and progress of Korean translation, please
