		Generic Sparse Group Lasso Solver // Fast generic solver for
		sparse group lasso optimization problems. The loss (objective)
		function must be defined in a C++ module. The optimization
		problem is solved using a coordinate gradient descent
		algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to a broad class of
		convex loss functions. Convergence of the algorithm is
		established (see reference).    Use of parallel computing for
		cross validation and subsampling is supported through the
		'foreach' and 'doParallel' packages. Development version is on
		github, please report package issues on github. Development
		version is on github, please report package issues on github.
