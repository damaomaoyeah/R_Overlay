		Generic Sparse Group Lasso Solver // Fast generic solver for
		sparse group lasso optimization problems. The loss (objective)
		function must be defined in a C++ module. The optimization
		problem is solved using a coordinate gradient descent
		algorithm. Convergence of the algorithm is established (see
		reference) and the algorithm is applicable to a broad class of
		loss functions. Use of parallel computing for cross validation
		and subsampling is supported through the 'foreach' and
		'doParallel' packages. Development version is on GitHub, please
		report package issues on GitHub.
