		Sparse group lasso generic optimizer // Fast generic solver for
		sparse group lasso optimization problems. The loss (objective)
		function must be defined in a C++ module. This package apply
		template metaprogramming techniques, therefore -- when
		compiling the package from source -- a high level of
		optimization is needed to gain full speed (e.g. for the GCC
		compiler use -O3). Use of multiple processors for cross
		validation and subsampling is supported through OpenMP. The
		Armadillo C++ library is used as the primary linear algebra
		engine. (The sglOptim package version a.b.c.d is interpreted as
		follows: a - primary version, b - major updates and fixes, c -
		source revision as corresponding to R-Forge, d - minor fixes
		made only to the CRAN branch of the source)
