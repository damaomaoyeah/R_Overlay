		Generic Sparse Group Lasso Solver // Fast generic solver for
		sparse group lasso optimization problems. The loss (objective)
		function must be defined in a C++ module. Use of multiple
		processors for cross validation and subsampling is supported
		through OpenMP. The optimization problem is solved using a
		coordinate gradient descent algorithm. The algorithm is
		applicable to a broad class of convex loss
		functions.Convergence of the algorithm is established (see
		reference). Development version is on github.
