		SciMark 2.0 Benchmark for Scientific and Numerical Computing //
		The SciMark 2.0 benchmark was originally developed in Java as a
		benchmark for numerical and scientific computational
		performance. It measures the performance of several
		computational kernels which are frequently occurring in
		scientific applications. This package is a simple wrapper
		around the ANSI C implementation of the benchmark.
