		Gaussian Process Ranking of Multiple Time Series // Implements a
		Gaussian process (GP)-based ranking method which can be used to
		rank multiple time series according to their temporal activity
		levels. An example is the case when expression levels of all
		genes are measured over a time course and the main concern is
		to identify the most active genes, i.e. genes which show
		significant non-random variation in their expression levels.
		This is achieved by computing Bayes factors for each time
		series by comparing the marginal likelihoods under time-
		dependent and time-independent GP models. Additional variance
		information from pre-processing of the observations is
		incorporated into the GP models, which makes the ranking more
		robust against model overfitting. The package supports
		exporting the results to 'tigreBrowser' for visualisation,
		filtering or ranking.
