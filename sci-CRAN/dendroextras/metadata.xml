		Extra functions to cut, label and colour dendrogram clusters //
		This package provides extra functions to manipulate dendrograms
		that build on the base functions provided by the stats package.
		The main functionality it is designed to add is the ability to
		colour all the edges in an object of class dendrogram according
		to cluster membership i.e. each subtree is coloured, not just
		the terminal leaves. In addition it provides some utility
		functions to cut dendrogram and hclust objects and to set/get
		labels.
