		Generate, Visualise, and Compare Fast and Frugal Decision Trees
		// Contains several functions that allow users to create,
		visualize, and test Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs). FFts are very
		simple decision trees for classifying cases (i.e.; breast
		cancer patients) into one of two classes (e.g.; no cancer vs.
		true cancer) based on a small number of cues (e.g.; test
		results). FFTs can be preferable to more complex algorithms
		(such as logistic regression) because they are easy to
		communicate and implement, and are robust against noisy data.
