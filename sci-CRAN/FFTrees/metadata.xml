		Generate, Visualise, and Compare Fast and Frugal Decision Trees
		// Contains several functions that allow you to create,
		visualise, and test Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTrees). FFTrees
		are very simple decision trees for classifying cases (i.e.;
		breast cancer patients) into one of two classes (e.g.; no
		cancer vs. true cancer) based on a small number of cues (e.g.;
		test results). FFTrees can be preferable to more complex
		algorithms (such as logistic regression) because they are easy
		to communicate and implement, and are robust against noisy
		data.
