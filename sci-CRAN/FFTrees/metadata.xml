		Generate, Visualise, and Compare Fast and Frugal Decision Trees
		// Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs) are very simple decision trees
		for classifying cases (i.e.; breast cancer patients) into one
		of two classes (e.g.; no cancer vs. true cancer). FFTs can be
		preferable to more complex algorithms (such as logistic
		regression) because they are easy to communicate and implement,
		and are robust against noisy data. This package contains
		several functions that allow users to create, visualize, and
		test FFts from their input their own data.
