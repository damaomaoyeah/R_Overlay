		Distributed Gaussian Process Calculations // Distributes Gaussian
		process calculations across nodes in a distributed memory
		setting, using Rmpi. The bigGP class provides high-level
		methods for maximum likelihood with normal data, prediction,
		calculation of uncertainty (i.e., posterior covariance
		calculations), and simulation of realizations. In addition,
		bigGP provides an API for basic matrix calculations with
		distributed covariance matrices, including Cholesky
		decomposition, back/forwardsolve, crossproduct, and matrix
		multiplication.
