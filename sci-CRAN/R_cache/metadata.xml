		Fast and light-weight caching (memoization) of objects and
		results to speed up computations // Memoization can be used to
		speed up repetitive and computational expensive function calls.
		The first time a function that implements memoization is called
		the results are stored in a cache memory.  The next time the
		function is called with the same set of parameters, the results
		are momentarily retrieved from the cache avoiding repeating the
		calculations.  With this package, any R object can be cached in
		a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary set of R
		objects.  The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).
