		Methods for Analyzing Multiple Response Categorical Variables
		(MRCVs) // The MRCV package provides functions for analyzing
		the association between one single response categorical
		variable (SRCV) and one multiple response categorical variable
		(MRCV), or between two or three MRCVs.  A modified Pearson chi-
		square statistic can be used to test for marginal independence
		for the one or two MRCV case, or a more general loglinear
		modeling approach can be used to examine various other
		structures of association for the two or three MRCV case.
		Bootstrap- and asymptotic-based standardized residuals and
		model-predicted odds ratios are available, in addition to other
		descriptive information.
