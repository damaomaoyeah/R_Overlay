		Robust Tail Dependence Estimation // Robust tail dependence
		estimation for bivariate models. This package is based on two
		papers by the authors:'Robust and bias-corrected estimation of
		the coefficient of tail dependence' and 'Robust and bias-
		corrected estimation of probabilities of extreme failure sets'.
		This work was supported by a research grant (VKR023480) from
		VILLUM FONDEN and an international project for scientific
		cooperation (PICS-6416).
