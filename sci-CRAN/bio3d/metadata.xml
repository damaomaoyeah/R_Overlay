		Biological Structure Analysis // Utilities to process, organize
		and explore protein structure, sequence and dynamics data.
		Features include the ability to read and write structure,
		sequence and dynamic trajectory data, perform sequence and
		structure database searches, data summaries, atom selection,
		alignment, superposition, rigid core identification,
		clustering, torsion analysis, distance matrix analysis,
		structure and sequence conservation analysis, normal mode
		analysis, principal component analysis of heterogeneous
		structure data, and correlation network analysis from normal
		mode and molecular dynamics data.  In addition, various utility
		functions are provided to enable the statistical and graphical
		power of the R environment to work with biological sequence and
		structural data.  Please refer to the URLs below for more
		information.
