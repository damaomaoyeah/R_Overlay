		Easy Handling of and Access to Files Organized in Structured
		Directories // A file set refers to a set of files located in
		one or more directories on the file system.  This package
		provides classes and methods to locate, setup, subset, navigate
		and iterate such sets.  The API is designed such that these
		classes can be extended via inheritance to provide a richer API
		for special file formats.  Moreover, a specific name format is
		defined such that filenames and directories can be considered
		to have full names which consists of a name followed by comma-
		separated tags.  This adds additional flexibility to identify
		file sets and individual files.  NOTE: This package's API
		should be considered to be in an beta stage.  Its main purpose
		is currently to support the aroma.* packages, where it is one
		of the main core components; if you decide to build on top of
		this package, please contact the author first.
