		HTTP and WebSocket Server Library // Provides low-level socket
		and protocol support for handling HTTP and WebSocket requests
		directly from within R. It is primarily intended as a building
		block for other packages, rather than making it particularly
		easy to create complete web applications using httpuv alone.
		httpuv is built on top of the libuv and http-parser C
		libraries, both of which were developed by Joyent, Inc. (See
		LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser license information.)
