		Objective Bayesian Testing for the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
		Problem // This package implements the general (multiallelic)
		Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium problem from an objective Bayesian
		testing standpoint. This aim is achieved through the
		identification of a class of priors specifically designed for
		this testing problem. A class of intrinsic priors under the
		full model is considered. This class is indexed by a tuning
		quantity, the training sample size, as discussed in Consonni,
		Moreno and Venturini (2010). These priors are objective,
		satisfy Savage's continuity condition and have proved to behave
		extremely well for many statistical testing problems.
