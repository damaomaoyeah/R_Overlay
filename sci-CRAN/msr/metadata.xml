		Morse-Smale Approximation, Regression and Visualization //
		Discrete Morse-Smale complex approximation based on kNN graph.
		The Morse-Smale complex provides a decomposition of the domain.
		This package provides methods to compute a hierarchical
		sequence of Morse-Smale complicies and tools that exploit this
		domain decomposition for regression and visualization of scalar
		functions.
