		Modelling anthropogenic deforestation // phcfM is an R package
		for modelling anthropogenic deforestation. It was initially
		developed to obtain REDD+ baseline scenarios of deforestation
		for the "programme holistique de conservation des forets a
		Madagascar" (from which the package is named after). Parameter
		inference is done in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Markov
		chains Monte Carlo (MCMC) are coded in C++ using the Scythe
		statistical library to maximize computation efficiency.
