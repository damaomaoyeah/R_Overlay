		Access and Plot CanVec and CanVec+ Data for Rapid Basemap
		Creation in Canada // Provides an interface to the National
		Topographic System (NTS), which is the way in which a number of
		freely available Canadian datasets are organized. CanVec and
		CanVec+ datasets, which include all data used to create
		Canadian topographic maps, are two such datasets that are
		useful in creating vector-based maps for locations across
		Canada. This packages searches CanVec data by location, plots
		it using pretty defaults, and exports it to human- readable
		shapefiles for use in another GIS.
