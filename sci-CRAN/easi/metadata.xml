		EASI Demand System Estimation // "easi" is a package for R
		enabling the estimation of the Exact Affine Stone Index demand
		system of Pendakur and Lewbel (2009). However, more than just a
		transcript, it offers a number of extensions in an unified
		framework. Firstly, it allows to calculate elasticities (income
		elasticities, price elasticities and demographic elasticities)
		and their standard deviations.  Secondly, it enables the
		calculation and the graphical representation of Engel curves
		and their confidence interval. Thirdly, it provides simulation
		tools to assess the impact of price changes, income changes and
		demographic changes on fitted budget shares, elasticities, and
		their standard deviations. Finally, easi allows the computation
		of equivalent incomes.
