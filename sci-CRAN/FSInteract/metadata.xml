		Fast Searches for Interactions // Performs fast detection of
		interactions in large-scale data using the method of random
		intersection trees introduced in ``Shah, R. D. and Meinshausen,
		N. (2014) Random Intersection Trees''.  The algorithm finds
		potentially high-order interactions in high-dimensional binary
		two-class classification data, without requiring lower order
		interactions to be informative.  The search is particularly
		fast when the matrices of predictors are sparse.  It can also
		be used to perform market basket analysis when supplied with a
		single binary data matrix.  Here it will find collections of
		columns which for many rows contain all 1's.
