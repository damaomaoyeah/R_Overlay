		Customized Training for Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized
		Generalized Linear Models // Customized training is a simple
		technique for transductive learning, when the test covariates
		are known at the time of training. The method identifies a
		subset of the training set to serve as the training set for
		each of a few identified subsets in the training set. This
		package implements customized training for the glmnet() and
		cv.glmnet() functions.
