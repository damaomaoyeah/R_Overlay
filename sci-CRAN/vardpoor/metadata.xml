		Variance estimation for sample surveys by the ultimate cluster
		method // Generation of domain variables, linearisation of
		several nonlinear population statistics (the ratio of two
		totals, weighted income percentile, at-risk-of-poverty rate,
		at-risk-of-poverty threshold, Gini coefficient, gender pay gap,
		median income below at-risk-of-poverty gap, income quintile
		share ratio, relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap),
		computation of regression residuals in case of weight
		calibration, variance estimation of sample surveys by the
		ultimate cluster method (Hansen, Hurwitz and Madow, 1953),
		variance estimation for longitudinal, crossectional measures
		and measures of change for single and multistage stage cluster
		sampling designs (Berger, Y.G.). Several other precision
		measures are derived - standard error, the coefficient of
		variation, the margin of error, confidence interval, design
		effect.
