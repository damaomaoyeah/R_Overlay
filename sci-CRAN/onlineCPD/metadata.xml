		Detect Changepoints in Multivariate Time Series // Detects
		multiple changepoints in uni- or multivariate time series data.
		The algorithm is based on Bayesian methods and detects changes
		on-line; i.e. the model updates with every observation rather
		than relying on retrospective segmentation. However, the user
		may choose to use the algorithm off- or on-line.
