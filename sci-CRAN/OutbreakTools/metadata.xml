		Basic Tools for the Analysis of Disease Outbreaks // Implements
		basic tools for storing, handling and visualizing disease
		outbreak data, as well as simple analysis tools. OutbreakTools
		defines the new formal class obkData which can be used to store
		any case-base outbreak data, and provides summaries for these
		objects, alongside a range of functions for subsetting and data
		manipulation. It implements a range of graphics for visualising
		timelines, maps, contact networks and genetic analyses. It also
		includes a simple case-base outbreak simulation tool.
