		Calculate Population Stratification // Implementation of
		ADMIXTURE for individual ancestry inference in R. Specifically,
		ADMIXTURE is a software tool for maximum likelihood estimation
		of individual ancestries from multilocus SNP genotype datasets,
		see https://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/admixture/. Users
		can use 'radmixture' to calculate ancestry components with
		different public datasets. It is very convenient and fast for
		personal genotype data. For more details, see
		https://github.com/wegene-llc/radmixture/blob/master/README.md.
