		Choice Modeling in R // Implements an MCMC algorithm to estimate
		a hierarchical multinomial logit model with a normal
		heterogeneity distribution. The algorithm uses a hybrid Gibbs
		Sampler with a random walk metropolis step for the MNL
		coefficients for each unit. Dependent variable may be discrete
		or continuous. Independent variables may be discrete or
		continuous with optional order constraints. Means of the
		distribution of heterogeneity can optionally be modeled as a
		linear function of unit characteristics variables.
