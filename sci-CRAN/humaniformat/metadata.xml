		A Parser for Human Names // Human names are complicated and
		nonstandard things. Humaniformat, which is based on Anthony
		Ettinger's 'humanparser' project
		(https://github.com/chovy/humanparser) provides functions for
		parsing human names, making a best-guess attempt to distinguish
		sub-components such as prefixes, suffixes, middle names and
		salutations.
