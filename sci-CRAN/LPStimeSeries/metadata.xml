		Learned Pattern Similarity and Representation for Time Series //
		Learned Pattern Similarity (LPS) for time series. Implements a
		novel approach to model the dependency structure in time series
		that generalizes the concept of autoregression to local auto-
		patterns. Generates a pattern-based representation of time
		series along with a similarity measure called Learned Pattern
		Similarity (LPS). Introduces a generalized autoregressive
		kernel.This package is based on the 'randomForest' package by
		Andy Liaw.
