		Gaussian, Poisson, and Binomial Hierarchical Modeling // Rgbp is
		an R package that utilizes approximate Bayesian machinery to
		provide a method of estimating two-level hierarchical models
		for Gaussian, Poisson, and Binomial data in a fast and
		computationally efficient manner. The main products of this
		package are point and interval estimates for the true
		parameters, whose good frequency properties can be validated
		via its repeated sampling procedure called frequency method
		checking. It is found that such Bayesian-frequentist
		reconciliation allows Rgbp to have attributes desirable both
		sides of the aisle, working well in small samples and yielding
		good coverage probabilities for its interval estimates.
