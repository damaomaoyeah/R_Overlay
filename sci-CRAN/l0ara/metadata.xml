		Sparse Generalized Linear Model with L0 Approximation for Feature
		Selection // An efficient procedure for feature selection for
		generalized linear models with L0 penalty, including linear,
		logistic, Poisson, gamma, inverse Gaussian regression. Adaptive
		ridge algorithms are used to fit the models.
