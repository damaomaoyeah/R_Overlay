		Kernel Density Estimation for Demonstration Purposes //
		Demonstration code showing how (univariate) kernel density
		estimates are computed, at least conceptually, and allowing
		users to experiment with different kernels, should they so
		wish.  NOTE: the density function in the stats package should
		be used for computational efficiency.
