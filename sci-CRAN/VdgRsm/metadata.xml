		Plots of Scaled Prediction Variances for Response Surface Designs
		// Functions for creating variance dispersion graphs, fraction
		of design space plots, and contour plots of scaled prediction
		variances for second-order response surface designs in
		spherical and cuboidal regions. Also, some standard response
		surface designs can be generated.
