		An Algorithm for Automatic Peak Detection in Noisy Periodic and
		Quasi-Periodic Signals // A method for automatic detection of
		peaks in noisy periodic and quasi-periodic signals. This
		method, called automatic multiscale-based peak detection
		(AMPD), is based on the calculation and analysis of the local
		maxima scalogram, a matrix comprising the scale-dependent
		occurrences of local maxima. For further information see
		doi:10.3390/a5040588.
