		Real-Time Signal Extraction (Direct Filter Approach) // The
		Direct Filter Approach (DFA) provides efficient estimates of
		signals at the current boundary of time series in real-time.
		For that purpose, one-sided ARMA-filters are computed by
		minimizing customized error criteria. The DFA can be used for
		estimating either the level or turning-points of a series,
		knowing that both criteria are incongruent. In the context of
		real-time turning- point detection, various risk-profiles can
		be operationalized, which account for the speed and/or the
		reliability of the one- sided filter.
