		File-Backed Matrix Class with Convenient Read and Write Access //
		Interface for working with large matrices stored in files, not
		in computer memory. Supports multiple non-character data types
		(double, integer, logical and raw) of various sizes (e.g. 8 and
		4 byte real values). Access to parts of the matrix is done by
		indexing, exactly as with usual R matrices. Supports very large
		matrices. Tested on multi-terabyte matrices. Allows for more
		than 2^32 rows or columns. Allows for quick addition of extra
		columns to a filematrix. Cross-platform as the package has R
		code only.
