		File-Backed Matrix Class with Convenient Read and Write Access //
		Interface for working with large matrices stored in files, not
		in computer memory. Supports multiple data types (double,
		integer, logical and raw) of different sizes (e.g. 4, 2, or 1
		byte integers). Access to parts of the matrix is done by
		indexing, exactly as with usual R matrices. Supports very large
		matrices (tested on 1 terabyte matrix), allowing for more than
		2^32 rows or columns. Cross-platform as the package has R code
		only, no C/C++.
