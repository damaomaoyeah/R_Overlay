		Wegener Center Climate Uncertainty Explorer // Methods to
		calculate and interpret climate change signals and time series
		from climate multi-model ensembles. Climate model output in
		binary 'NetCDF' format is read in and aggregated over a
		specified region to a data.frame for statistical analysis.
		Global Circulation Models, as the 'CMIP5' simulations, can be
		read in the same way as Regional Climate Models, as e.g. the
		'CORDEX' or 'ENSEMBLES' simulations. The package has been
		developed at the 'Wegener Center for Climate and Global Change'
		at the University of Graz, Austria.
