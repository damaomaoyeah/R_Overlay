		Ecological and biogeographical null model tests for comparing
		rarefaction curves // Randomization tests for the statistical
		comparison of \emph{i} = two or more individual-based, sample-
		based or coverage-based rarefaction curves. The ecological null
		hypothesis is that the \emph{i} samples were all drawn randomly
		from a single assemblage, with (necessarily) a single
		underlying species abundance distribution. The biogeographic
		null hypothesis is that the \emph{i} samples were all drawn
		from different assemblages that, nonetheless, share similar
		species richness and species abundance distributions
