		visualisation and analysis of food web networks // Calculates
		twelve commonly-used, basic measures of food web network
		structure from binary, predator-prey matrices: species
		richness, connectance, total number of links, link density,
		number of trophic positions, predator:prey ratio, and fraction
		of carnivores, herbivores, top species and intermediate
		species.  Employs food web language in the code and output,
		translates between a couple of common food web formats, can
		handle food webs consisting of multiple levels, and can
		automate the analysis for a large number of webs. The program
		produces 3-dimensional graphs of high quality that can be
		customized by the user.
