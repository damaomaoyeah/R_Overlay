		Monte Carlo Standard Errors for MCMC // Provides tools for
		computing Monte Carlo standard errors (MCSE) in Markov chain
		Monte Carlo (MCMC) settings. MCSE computation for expectation
		and quantile estimators is supported as well as multivariate
		estimations. The package also provides functions for computing
		effective sample size and for plotting Monte Carlo estimates
		versus sample size.
