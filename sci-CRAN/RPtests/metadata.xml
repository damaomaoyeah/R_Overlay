		Goodness of Fit Tests for High-Dimensional Linear Regression
		Models // Performs goodness of fits tests for both high and
		low-dimensional linear models. It can test for a variety of
		model misspecifications including nonlinearity and
		heteroscedasticity. In addition one can test the significance
		of potentially large groups of variables, and also produce
		p-values for the significance of individual variables in high-
		dimensional linear regression.
