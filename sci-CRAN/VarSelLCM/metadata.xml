		Variable Selection for Model-Based Clustering using the
		Integrated Complete-Data Likelihood of a Latent Class Model //
		Uses a finite mixture model for performing the cluster analysis
		with variable selection of continuous data by assuming
		independence between classes. The package deals dataset with
		missing values by assuming that values are missing at random.
		The one-dimensional marginals of the components follow Gaussian
		distributions for facilitating both model interpretation and
		model selection. The variable selection is led by the Maximum
		Integrated Complete-Data Likelihood criterion. The maximum
		likelihood inference is done by an EM algorithm for the
		selected model. This package also performs the imputation of
		missing values.
