		Functions to Automate Downloading Geospatial Data Available from
		Several Federated Data Sources // Functions to automate
		downloading geospatial data available from several federated
		data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal
		government). Currently, the package allows for retrieval of
		four datasets: The National Elevation Dataset digital elevation
		models (1 and 1/3 arc-second; USGS); The National Hydrography
		Dataset (USGS); The Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database
		from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is led
		by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the
		USDA; and the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN),
		coordinated by National Climatic Data Center at NOAA.
		Additional data sources are in the works, including global DEM
		resources (ETOPO1, ETOPO5, ETOPO30, SRTM), global soils (HWSD),
		tree-ring records (ITRDB), MODIS satellite data products, the
		National Atlas (US), Natural Earth, PRISM, and WorldClim.
