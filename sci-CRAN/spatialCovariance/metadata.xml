		Computation of spatial covariance matrices for data on rectangles
		// Functions that compute the spatial covariance matrix for the
		matern and power classes of spatial models, for data that arise
		on rectangular units.  This code can also be used for the
		change of support problem and for spatial data that arise on
		irregularly shaped regions like counties or zipcodes by laying
		a fine grid of rectangles and aggregating the integrals in a
		form of Riemann integration.
