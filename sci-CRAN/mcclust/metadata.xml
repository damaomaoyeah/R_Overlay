		Process an MCMC Sample of Clusterings // Implements methods for
		processing a sample of (hard) clusterings, e.g. the MCMC output
		of a Bayesian clustering model. Among them are methods that
		find a single best clustering to represent the sample, which
		are based on the posterior similarity matrix or a relabelling
		algorithm.
