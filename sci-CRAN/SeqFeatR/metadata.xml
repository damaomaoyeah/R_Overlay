		A Tool to Associate FASTA Sequences and Features // SeqFeatR
		provides user friendly methods for the identification of
		sequence patterns that are statistically significantly
		associated with a property of the sequence. For instance,
		SeqFeatR allows to identify viral immune escape mutations for
		hosts of given HLA types. The underlying statistical method is
		Fisher's exact test, with appropriate corrections for multiple
		testing. Patterns may be point mutations or n-tuple of
		mutations. SeqFeatR offers several ways to visualize the
		results of the statistical analyses.
