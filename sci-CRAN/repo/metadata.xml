		A Resource Manager for R Objects // This is an R data manager
		meant to avoid manual storage/retrieval of R data to/from the
		file system. It builds one (or more) centralized repository
		where R objects are stored with annotations, tags, dependency
		notes, provenance traces. It also provides navigation tools to
		easily locate, load and edit previously stored resources.
