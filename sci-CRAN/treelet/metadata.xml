		An Adaptive Multi-Scale Basis for High-Dimensional, Sparse and
		Unordered Data // Treelets provides a novel construction of
		multi-scale bases that extends wavelets to non-smooth signals.
		It returns a multi-scale orthonormal basis, where the final
		computed basis functions are supported on nested clusters in a
		hierarchical tree.  Both the tree and the basis, which are
		constructed simultaneously, reflect the internal structure of
		the data.
