		Performing multivariate dose-response meta-analysis // It
		estimates a dose-response relation from either a single or
		multiple summarized data. The trend estimation takes into
		account the correlation among sets of log relative risks and
		use it to efficiently estimate the dose-response relation. To
		obtain a pooled functional relation, the study-specific trends
		are combined according to principles of multivariate random-
		effects meta-analysis.
