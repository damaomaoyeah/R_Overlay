		Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnections in R // Empirical orthogonal
		teleconnections in R. 'remote' is short for "R(-based)
		EMpirical Orthogonal TEleconnections". It implements a
		collection of functions to facilitate empirical orthogonal
		teleconnection analysis. Empirical Orthogonal Teleconnections
		(EOTs) denote a regression based approach to decompose spatio-
		temporal fields into a set of independent orthogonal patterns.
		They are quite similar to Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs)
		with EOTs producing less abstract results. In contrast to EOFs,
		which are orthogonal in both space and time, EOT analysis
		produces patterns that are orthogonal in either space or time.
