		Structural Equation Modeling using the reticular action model
		(RAM) Notation // RAMpath is a rewrite of RAMpath software
		developed by John McArdle and Steven Boker. In addition to
		performing regular SEM analysis through the R package lavaan,
		RAMpath has unique features.  First, it can generate path
		diagrams according to a given model. Second, it can display
		path tracing rules through path diagrams and decompose total
		effects into their respective direct and indirect effects as
		well as decompose variances and covariances into individual
		bridges. Furthermore, RAMpath can fit dynamic system models
		automatically based on latent change scores and generate vector
		field plots based upon results obtained from a bivariate
		dynamic system.
