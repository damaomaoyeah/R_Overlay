		Bivariate Copula Based Regression Models // This R-packages
		presents a bivariate, copula-based model for the joint
		distribution of a pair of continuous and discrete random
		variables. The two marginal random variables are modeled via
		generalized linear models, and their joint distribution
		(represented by a parametric copula family) is estimated using
		maximum-likelihood techniques.
