		Performs spatial NBDA in a Bayesian context // Network based
		diffusion analysis (NBDA) allows inference on the asocial and
		social transmission of information.  This may involve the
		social transmission of a particular behaviour such as tool use,
		for example. For the NBDA, the key parameters estimated are the
		social effect and baseline rate parameters.  The baseline rate
		parameter gives the rate at which the behaviour is first
		performed (or acquired) asocially amongst the individuals in a
		given population. The social effect parameter quantifies the
		effect of the social associations amongst the individuals on
		the rate at which each individual first performs or displays
		the behaviour.  Spatial NBDA involves incorporating spatial
		information in the analysis. This is done by incorporating
		social networks derived from spatial point patterns (of the
		home bases of the individuals under study).  In addition, a
		spatial covariate such as vegetation cover, or slope may be
		included in the modelling process.
