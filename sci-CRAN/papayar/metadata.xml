		View Medical Research Images using the Papaya JavaScript Library
		// Users pass images and objects of class 'nifti' from the
		'oro.nifti' package to a Papaya, an interactive lightweight
		JavaScript viewer. Although many packages can view individual
		slices or projections of image and matrix data, this package
		allows for quick and easy interactive browsing of images.  The
		viewer is based off of the Mango software, which is a
		lightweight medical image viewer.
