		Easy analysis and visualization of factorial experiments. // This
		package facilitates easy analysis of factorial experiments,
		including purely within-Ss designs (a.k.a. "repeated
		measures"), purely between-Ss designs, and mixed within-and-
		between-Ss designs. The functions in this package aim to
		provide simple, intuitive and consistent specification of data
		analysis and visualization. Visualization functions also
		include design visualization for pre-analysis data auditing,
		and correlation matrix visualization. Finally, this package
		includes functions for non-parametric analysis, including
		permutation tests and bootstrap resampling. The bootstrap
		function obtains predictions either by cell means or by more
		advanced/powerful mixed effects models, yielding predictions
		and confidence intervals that may be easily visualized at any
		level of the experiment's design.
