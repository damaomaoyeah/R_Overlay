		Modeling without data using expert opinion // Expert opinion (or
		judgment) is a body of techniques to estimate the distribution
		of a random variable when data is scarce or unavailable.
		Opinions on the quantiles of the distribution are sought from
		experts in the field and aggregated into a final estimate. The
		package supports aggregation by means of the Cooke, Mendel-
		Sheridan and predefined weights models.
