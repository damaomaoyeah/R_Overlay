		Analysis and Visualization Likert Items // An approach to
		analyzing Likert response items, with an emphasis on
		visualizations. The stacked bar plot is the preferred method
		for presenting Likert results. Tabular results are also
		implemented along with density plots to assist researchers in
		determining whether Likert responses can be used quantitatively
		instead of qualitatively. See the likert(), summary.likert(),
		and plot.likert() functions to get started.
