		Modeling Earthquake Data Using ETAS Model // Fitting the space-
		time Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model to
		earthquake catalogs using a stochastic declustering approach.
		The ETAS model is a spatio-temporal marked point process model
		and a special case of the Hawcks process. The package is based
		on Fortran code by Jiancang Zhuang (available at
		http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html), which is
		translated into C such that it can be called from R.
