		Estimation and Simulation for PDMPs // This package deals with
		the estimation of the jump rate for piecewise-deterministic
		Markov processes (PDMPs), from only one observation of the
		process within a long time. The main functions provide an
		estimate of this function. The state space may be discrete or
		continuous. The associated paper has been published in
		Scandinavian Journal of Statistics and is given in references.
		Other functions provide a method to simulate random variables
		from their (conditional) hazard rate, and then to simulate
		PDMPs.
