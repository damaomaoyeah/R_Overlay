		Multinomial Logit Model // Time and memory efficient estimation
		of multinomial logit models using maximum likelihood method.
		Numerical optimization performed by Newton-Raphson method using
		an optimized, parallel C++ library to achieve fast computation
		of Hessian matrices. Motivated by large scale multiclass
		classification problems in econometrics and machine learning.
