		Biological Network Construction, Visualization and Analyses //
		High-throughput experiments are now widely used in biological
		researches, which improves both the quality and quantity of
		omics data. Network-based presentation of these data has become
		a popular way in data analyses. This package mainly provides
		functions for biological network construction, visualization
		and analyses. Networks can be constructed either from
		experimental data or from a set of proteins and integrated PPI
		database. Based on them, users can perform traditional
		visualization, along with the subcellular localization based
		ones for Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore,
		analyses including topological statistics, functional module
		clustering and go profiling can also be achieved.
