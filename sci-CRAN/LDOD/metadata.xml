		generalized linear models. // this package provides functions
		for Finding Locally D-optimal designs for Logistic, Negative
		Binomial, Poisson, Michaelis-Menten, Exponential, Log-Linear,
		Emax, Richards, Weibull and Inverse Quadratic regression models
		and also functions for auto-constructing Fisher information
		matrix and Frechet derivative based on some input variables and
		without user-interfere.
