		Biplot representations of ordinal variables // Analysis of a
		matrix of polytomous items using Ordinal Logistic Biplots (OLB)
		The OLB procedure extends the binary logistic biplot to ordinal
		(polytomous) data. The  individuals are represented as points
		on a plane and the variables are represented as lines rather
		than vectors as in a classical or binary biplot, specifying the
		points for each of the categories of the variable. The set of
		prediction regions is established by stripes perpendicular to
		the line between the category points, in such a way that the
		prediction for each individual is given by its projection into
		the line of the variable.
