		Hierarchical Bayesian Regression for GLMs // Convenient and
		efficient functions for performing 2-level hierarchical
		Bayesian regression analysis for multi-group data. The lowest
		level may belong to the generalized linear model (GLM) family
		while the prior level, which effects pooling, allows for linear
		regression on lower level covariates. Constraints on all or
		part of the parameter set maybe specified with ease. A rich set
		of methods is included to visualize and analyze results.
