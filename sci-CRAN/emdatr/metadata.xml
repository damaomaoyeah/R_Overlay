		Global Disaster Losses from the EMDAT Database Using R // The
		'EMDAT' database provides information on human and financial
		losses from more than 21,000 major natural global disasters
		from 1900 to the present. This package provides the entire data
		available from 'EMDAT' and also additional relevant information
		such as historical national GDP and population. Moreover, this
		package also provides functionality to extract desired subsets
		of the 'EMDAT' data. The examples provided in the vignette
		demonstrate the functionality provided by 'emdatr'. The goal of
		'emdatr' is to promote the use of 'EMDAT' data, bring
		transparency to the data, shed light on the limitations of the
		data, and make the analysis of the data easier using R.
