		Application of MOSS algorithm to genome-wide association study
		(GWAS) // This is a genMOSS package with additional datafile
		preprocessing functions. Performs genome-wide analysis of dense
		SNP array data using the mode oriented stochastic search (MOSS)
		algorithm in a case-control design. The MOSS algorithm is a
		Bayesian variable selection procedure that is applicable to
		GWAS data. It identifies combinations of the best predictive
		SNPs associated with the response. It also performs a
		hierarchical log-linear model search to identify the most
		relevant associations among the resulting subsets of SNPs. This
		package also includes preprocessing of the data from Plink
		format to the format required by the MOSS algorithm.
