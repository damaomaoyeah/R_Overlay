		Creates empty plots with compact axis notation // Creates empty
		plots with compact axis notation to which users can add
		whatever they like (points, lines, text, etc.) The notation is
		more compact in the sense that the axis-labels and tick-labels
		are closer to the axis and the tick-marks are shorter. Also, if
		the plot appears as part of a matrix, the x-axis notation is
		suppressed unless the plot appears along the bottom row and the
		y-axis notation is suppress unless the plot appears along the
		left column.
