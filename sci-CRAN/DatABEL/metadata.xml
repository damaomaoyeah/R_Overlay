		File-Based Access to Large Matrices Stored on HDD in Binary
		Format // Provides an interface to the C++ FILEVECTOR library
		facilitating analysis using large (giga- to tera-bytes)
		matrices. Matrix storage is organized in a way that either
		columns or rows are quickly accessible. DatABEL is primarily
		aimed to support genome-wide association analyses e.g. using
		GenABEL, MixABEL and ProbABEL.
