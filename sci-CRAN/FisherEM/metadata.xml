		The Fisher-EM algorithm // The FisherEM package provides an
		efficient algorithm for the unsupervised classification of
		high-dimensional data. This FisherEM algorithm models and
		clusters the data in a discriminative and low-dimensional
		latent subspace. It also provides a low-dimensional
		representation of the clustered data. A sparse version of
		Fisher-EM algorithm is also provided.
