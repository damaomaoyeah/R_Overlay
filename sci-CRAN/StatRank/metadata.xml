		Statistical Rank Aggregation: Inference, Evaluation, and
		Visualization // This package implements Generalized Method of
		Moments and Maximal Likelihood methods for Random Utility
		Models. These methods are meant to provide inference on rank
		comparison data. These methods accept full, partial, and
		pairwise rankings, and provides methods to break down full or
		partial rankings into their pairwise components. Please see
		Generalized Method-of-Moments for Rank Aggregation from NIPS
		2013 for a description of some of our methods.
