		Significance Analysis of Event-Related Potentials Data // The
		functions provided in the package ERP are designed for the
		significance analysis of ERP data in a linear model framework.
		The possible procedures are either the collection of FDR or
		FWER controlling methods available in the generic function
		p.adjust, the same collection combined with a factor modeling
		of the time dependence among tests (see Sheu, Perthame, Lee and
		Causeur, 2016) and the Guthrie and Buchwald (1991) test.
