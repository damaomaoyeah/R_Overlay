		A Bayesian Semiparametric Factor Analysis Model for Subtype
		Identification (Clustering) // Gene expression profiles are
		commonly utilized to infer disease subtypes and many clustering
		methods can be adopted for this task. However, existing
		clustering methods may not perform well when genes are highly
		correlated and many uninformative genes are included for
		clustering. To deal with these challenges, we develop a novel
		clustering method in the Bayesian setting. This method, called
		BCSub, adopts an innovative semiparametric Bayesian factor
		analysis model to reduce the dimension of the data to a few
		factor scores for clustering. Specifically, the factor scores
		are assumed to follow the Dirichlet process mixture model in
		order to induce clustering.
