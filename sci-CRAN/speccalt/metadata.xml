		Alternative spectral clustering, with automatic estimation of k.
		// Alternative to the kernlab::specc function. Includes a
		spectral clustering implementation, a locally adapted kernel
		function akin to what is already proposed in kernlab, and an
		optional procedure that automatically estimates the optimal
		number of clusters. Several sample data sets are also included.
