		Estimation of Extreme Value Dependence for Time Series Data //
		Estimation of the sample univariate, cross and return time
		extremograms. The package can also add empirical confidence
		bands to each of the extremogram plots via a permutation
		procedure under the assumption that the data are independent.
		Finally, the stationary bootstrap allows us to construct
		credible confidence bands for the extremograms.
