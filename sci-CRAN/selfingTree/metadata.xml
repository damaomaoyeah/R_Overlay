		Genotype Probabilities in Intermediate Generations of Inbreeding
		Through Selfing // A probability tree allows to compute
		probabilities of complex events, such as genotype probabilities
		in intermediate generations of inbreeding through recurrent
		self-fertilization (selfing). This package implements
		functionality to compute probability trees for two- and three-
		marker genotypes in the F2 to F7 selfing generations. The
		conditional probabilities are derived automatically and in
		symbolic form. The package also provides functionality to
		extract and evaluate the relevant probabilities.
