		Permutational Group Sequential Test for Time-to-Event Data //
		Permutational group-sequential tests for time-to-event data
		based on the log-rank test statistic. Supports exact
		permutation test when the censoring distributions are equal in
		the treatment and the control group and approximate imputation-
		permutation methods when the censoring distributions are
		different.
