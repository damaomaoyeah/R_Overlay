		Co-Information based N-Order Epistasis Detector and Visualizer //
		Detecting and visualizing nonlinear interaction effects of
		single nucleotide polymorphisms or epistatic interactions,
		especially high-order epistatic interactions, are important
		topics in bioinformatics because of their significant
		mathematical and computational challenges. We present CINOEDV
		(Co-Information based N-Order Epistasis Detector and
		Visualizer) for detecting, visualizing, and analyzing high-
		order epistatic interactions by introducing virtual vertices
		into the construction of a hypergraph. CINOEDV was developed as
		an alternative to existing software to build a global picture
		of epistatic interactions and unexpected high-order epistatic
		interactions, which might provide useful clues for
		understanding the underlying genetic architecture of complex
		diseases.
