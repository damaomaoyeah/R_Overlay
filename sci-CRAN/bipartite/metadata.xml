		Visualising Bipartite Networks and Calculating Some (Ecological)
		Indices // Functions to visualise webs and calculate a series
		of indices commonly used to describe pattern in (ecological)
		webs. It focuses on webs consisting of only two levels
		(bipartite), e.g. pollination webs or predator-prey-webs.
		Visualisation is important to get an idea of what we are
		actually looking at, while the indices summarise different
		aspects of the web's topology.
