		Visualising bipartite networks and calculating some (ecological)
		indices. // Bipartite provides functions to visualise webs and
		calculate a series of indices commonly used to describe pattern
		in ecological webs. It focuses on webs consisting of only two
		trophic levels, e.g. pollination webs or predator-prey-webs.
		Visualisation is important to get an idea of what we are
		actually looking at, while the indices summarise different
		aspects of the webs topology.
