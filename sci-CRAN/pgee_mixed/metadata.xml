		Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations for Bivariate Mixed
		Outcomes // Perform simultaneous estimation and variable
		selection for correlated bivariate mixed outcomes (one
		continuous outcome and one binary outcome per cluster) using
		penalized generalized estimating equations. In addition,
		clustered Gaussian and binary outcomes can also be modeled. The
		SCAD, MCP, and LASSO penalties are supported. Cross-validation
		can be performed to find the optimal regularization
		parameter(s).
