		Bayesian Experimental Design for Systems Biology. //
		Implementation of a Bayesian active learning strategy to carry
		out sequential experimental design in the context of
		biochemical network kinetic parameter estimation. This package
		gathers functions and pre-computed data sets to reproduce
		results presented in Pauwels E. et. al published in BMC Systems
		Biology, 2014. Scripts are given to compute all results from
		scratch or to draw pictures based on pre-computed data sets.
