		Design and Monitoring of Survival Trials Accounting for Complex
		Situations // Calculates various functions needed for design
		and monotoring survival trials accounting for complex
		situations such as delayed treatment effect, treatment
		crossover, non-uniform accrual, and different censoring
		distributions between groups. The event time distribution is
		assumed to be piecewise exponential (PWE) distribution and the
		entry time is assumed to be piecewise uniform distribution.
