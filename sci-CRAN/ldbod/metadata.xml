		Local Density-Based Outlier Detection // Flexible procedures to
		compute local density-based outlier scores for ranking
		outliers. Both exact and approximate nearest neighbor search
		can be implemented, while also accommodating multiple k values
		and four different local density-based methods. It allows for
		referencing a random subsample of input data or a user
		specified reference data set to compute outlier scores against,
		so both unsupervised and semi-supervised outlier detection can
		be implemented.
