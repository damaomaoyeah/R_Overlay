		Download, slice, and normalize GDELT data // The GDELT data set
		is over 60 GB now and growing 100 MB a month. The number of
		source articles has increased over time and unevenly across
		countries. This package makes it easy to download a subset of
		that data, then normalize that data to facilitate valid time
		series analysis.
