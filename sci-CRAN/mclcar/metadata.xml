		Estimating Conditional Auto-Regression (CAR) Models using Monte
		Carlo Likelihood Methods // The likelihood of direct CAR models
		and Binomial and Poisson GLM with latent CAR variables are
		approximated by the Monte Carlo likelihood. The Maximum Monte
		Carlo likelihood estimator is found either by an iterative
		procedure of directly maximising the Monte Carlo approximation
		or by a response surface design method.
