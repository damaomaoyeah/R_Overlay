		Tools for Visualization of Interdependent Data Quality Issues //
		Data quality issues such as missing values and outliers are
		often interdependent, which makes preprocessing both time-
		consuming and leads to suboptimal performance in knowledge
		discovery tasks. This package supports preprocessing decision
		making by visualizing interdependent data quality issues
		through means of feature construction. The user can define his
		own application domain specific constructed features that
		express the quality of a data point such as number of missing
		values in the point or use nine default features. The outcome
		can be explored with plot methods and the feature constructed
		data acquired with get methods.
