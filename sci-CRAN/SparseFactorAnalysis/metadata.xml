		Scaling Count and Binary Data with Sparse Factor Analysis //
		Multidimensional scaling provides a means of uncovering a
		latent structure underlying observed data, while estimating the
		number of latent dimensions.  This package presents a means for
		scaling binary and count data, for example the votes and word
		counts for legislators.  Future work will include an EM
		implementation and extend this work to ordinal and continuous
		data.
