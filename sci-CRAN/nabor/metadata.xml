		Wraps 'libnabo', a Fast K Nearest Neighbour Library for Low
		Dimensions // An R wrapper for 'libnabo', an exact or
		approximate k nearest neighbour library which is optimised for
		low dimensional spaces (e.g. 3D). 'libnabo' has speed and space
		advantages over the 'ANN' library wrapped by package 'RANN'.
		'nabor' includes a knn function that is designed as a drop-in
		replacement for 'RANN' function nn2. In addition, objects which
		include the k-d tree search structure can be returned to speed
		up repeated queries of the same set of target points.
