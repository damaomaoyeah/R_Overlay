		Bureau of Economic Analysis API // Provides an R interface for
		the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) API (see
		http://www.bea.gov/API/bea_web_service_api_user_guide.htm for
		more information) that serves two core purposes - 1. To
		Extract/Transform/Load data [beaGet()] from the BEA API as
		R-friendly formats in the user's work space [transformation
		done by default in beaGet() can be modified using optional
		parameters; see, too, bea2List(), bea2Tab()]. 2. To enable the
		search of descriptive meta data [beaSearch()]. Other features
		of the library exist mainly as intermediate methods or are in
		early stages of development. Important Note - You must have an
		API key to use this library. Register for a key at
		http://www.bea.gov/API/signup/index.cfm .
