		Cox Regression with Firth's Penalized Likelihood // Implements
		Firth's penalized maximum likelihood bias reduction method  for
		Cox regression which has been shown to provide a solution in
		case of monotone likelihood (nonconvergence of likelihood
		function). The program fits profile penalized likelihood
		confidence intervals which were proved to outperform Wald
		confidence intervals.
