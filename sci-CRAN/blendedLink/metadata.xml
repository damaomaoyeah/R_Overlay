		A New Link Function that Blends Two Specified Link Functions // A
		new link function that equals one specified link function up to
		a cutover then a linear rescaling of another specified link
		function. For use in glm() or glm2(). The intended use is in
		binary regression, in which case the first link should be set
		to "log" and the second to "logit". This ensures that fitted
		probabilities are between 0 and 1 and that exponentiated
		coefficients can be interpreted as relative risks for
		probabilities up to the cutoff.
