		Kaplan - Meier estimator with constraints for right censored data
		-- a recursive computational algorithm // Calculate NPMLE with
		constraints for right censored data. This package give a
		recursive computational algorithm for the "constrained" Kaplan-
		Meier estimator. The constraint is assumed given in linear
		estimating equations or mean functions. We also illustrate how
		this leads to the empirical likelihood ratio test with right
		censored data. EM algorithm (emplik) is used to get the initial
		value.
