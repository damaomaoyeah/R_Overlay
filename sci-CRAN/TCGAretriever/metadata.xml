		Retrieve Genomic and Clinical Data from TCGA // The Cancer Genome
		Atlas (TCGA) is a program aimed at improving our understanding
		of Cancer Biology. Several TCGA Datasets are available online.
		'TCGAretriever' helps accessing and downloading TCGA data
		hosted on 'cBioPortal' via its Web Interface (see
		http://www.cbioportal.org/web_api.jsp for more information).
		Features of 'TCGAretriever' include: 1) it is very simple to
		use (get all the TCGA data you need with a few lines of code);
		2) performance (smooth and reliable data download via 'httr');
		3) it is tailored for downloading large volumes of data.
