		Predictive Analysis of Clinical Trials // A prediction-based
		approach to the analysis of data from randomized clinical
		trials is implemented. Based on response and covariate data
		from a randomized clinical trial comparing a new experimental
		treatment E versus a control C, the objective is to develop and
		internally validate a model that can identify subjects likely
		to benefit from E rather than C. Currently, survival and binary
		response types are permitted.
