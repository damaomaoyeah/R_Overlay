		Normality and White Noise Testing // Includes Omnibus Univariate
		and Multivariate Normality Tests (See Doornik and Hansen
		(1994)). One variation allows for the possibility of weak
		dependence rather than independence in the variable(s). Also
		included is an univariate white noise test where the null
		hypothesis is "white noise" rather than strict "white noise".
