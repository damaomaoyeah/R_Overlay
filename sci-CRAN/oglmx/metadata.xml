		Estimation of Ordered Generalized Linear Models // Ordered models
		such as ordered probit and ordered logit presume that the error
		variance is constant across observations. In the case that this
		assumption does not hold estimates of marginal effects are
		typically biased. This package allows for generalization of
		ordered probit and ordered logit models by allowing the user to
		specify a model for the variance. Furthermore, the package
		includes functions to calculate the marginal effects. Wrapper
		functions to estimate the standard limited dependent variable
		models are also included.
