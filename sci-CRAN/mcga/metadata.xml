		Machine Coded Genetic Algorithms for Real-Valued Optimization
		Problems // Machine coded genetic algorithm (MCGA) is a fast
		tool for real-valued optimization problems. It uses the byte
		representation of variables rather than real-values. It
		performs the classical crossover operations (uniform) on these
		byte representations. Mutation operator is also similar to
		classical mutation operator, which is to say, it changes a
		randomly selected byte value of a chromosome by +1 or -1 with
		probability 1/2. In MCGAs there is no need for encoding-
		decoding process and the classical operators are directly
		applicable on real-values. It is fast and can handle a wide
		range of a search space with high precision. Using a 256-unary
		alphabet is the main disadvantage of this algorithm but a
		moderate size population is convenient for many problems.
		Package also includes multi_mcga function for multi objective
		optimization problems. This function sorts the chromosomes
		using their ranks calculated from the non-dominated sorting
		algorithm.
