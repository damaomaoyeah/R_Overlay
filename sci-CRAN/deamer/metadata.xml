		Deconvolution density estimation with adaptive methods for a
		variable prone to measurement error // deamer provides
		deconvolution algorithms for the non-parametric estimation of
		the density f of an error-prone variable x with additive noise
		e. The model is y = x + e where the noisy variable y is
		observed, while x is unobserved. Estimation may be performed
		for i) a known density of the error ii) with an auxiliary
		sample of pure noise and iii) with an auxiliary sample of
		replicate (repeated) measurements. Estimation is performed
		using adaptive model selection and penalized contrasts.
