		Easily Download and Visualise Climate Data from CliFlo // CliFlo
		is a web portal to the New Zealand National Climate Database
		and provides public access (via subscription) to around 6,500
		various climate stations (see http://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/ for
		more information). Collating and manipulating data from CliFlo
		(hence clifro) and importing into R for further analysis,
		exploration and visualisation is now straightforward and
		coherent. The user is required to have an internet connection,
		and a current CliFlo subscription (free) if data from stations,
		other than the public Reefton electronic weather station, is
		sought.
