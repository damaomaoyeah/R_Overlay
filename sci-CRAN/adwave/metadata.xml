		Wavelet Analysis of Genomic Data from Admixed Populations //
		Implements wavelet-based approaches for describing population
		admixture. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to
		define the population structure and produce a localized
		admixture signal for each individual. Wavelet summaries of the
		PCA output describe variation present in the data and can be
		related to population-level demographic processes. For more
		details, see Sanderson et al. (2015).
