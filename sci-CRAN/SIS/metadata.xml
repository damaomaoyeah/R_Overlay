		Sure Independence Screening // Variable selection techniques are
		essential tools for model selection and estimation in high-
		dimensional statistical models. Through this publicly available
		package, we provide a unified environment to carry out variable
		selection using iterative sure independence screening (SIS) and
		all of its variants in generalized linear models and the Cox
		proportional hazards model.
