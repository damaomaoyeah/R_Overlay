		Dithionite Scramblase Assay Analysis // The lipid scrambling
		activity of protein extracts and purified scramblases is often
		determined using a fluorescence-based assay involving many
		manual steps. flippant offers an integrated solution for the
		analysis and publication-grade graphical presentation of
		dithionite scramblase assays, as well as a platform for review,
		dissemination and extension of the strategies it employs. The
		package's name derives from a play on the fact that lipid
		scrambling is also sometimes referred to as 'flipping'.
