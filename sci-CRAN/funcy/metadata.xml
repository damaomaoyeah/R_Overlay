		Functional Clustering Algorithms // Unified framework to cluster
		functional data according to one of seven models. All models
		are based on the projection of the curves onto a basis. The
		main function funcit() calls wrapper functions for the existing
		algorithms, so that input parameters are the same. A list is
		returned with each entry representing the same or extended
		output for the corresponding method. Method specific as well as
		general visualization tools are available.
