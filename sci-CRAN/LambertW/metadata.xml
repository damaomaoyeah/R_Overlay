		Analyze and Gaussianize Heavy-Tailed, Skewed Data // Lambert W x
		F distributions are a generalized framework to analyze skewed,
		heavy-tailed data. They are based on an input/output system,
		where the input random variable (RV) X ~ F, and the output Y is
		a non-linearly transformed version of X with similar
		properties, but slightly skewed and/or heavy-tailed. This
		transformed RV Y has a Lambert W x F distribution. This package
		contains functions to model and analyze skewed, heavy-tailed
		data the Lambert Way: simulate random samples, estimate
		parameters, compute quantiles, and plot/print results nicely.
		Probably the most important function is 'Gaussianize', which
		works similarly to 'scale', but actually makes the data
		Gaussian.  A do-it-yourself toolkit allows users to define
		their own Lambert W x 'MyFavoriteDistribution' and use it in
		their analysis right away.
