		Trust region nonlinear optimization, efficient for sparse
		Hessians // Trust region algorithm for nonlinear optimization.
		In addition to being more stable and robust than optim, this
		package includes methods that are scalable and efficient (in
		terms of both speed and memory usage) when the Hessian is
		sparse.
