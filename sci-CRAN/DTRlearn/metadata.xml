		Learning Algorithms for Dynamic Treatment Regimes // Dynamic
		treatment regimens (DTRs) are sequential decision rules
		tailored at each stage by potentially time-varying patient
		features and intermediate outcomes observed in previous stages.
		There are 3 main type methods, O-learning, Q-learning and
		P-learning to learn the optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with
		continuous variables. This package provide these state of arts
		algorithms to learn DTRs.
