		Learning Algorithms for Dynamic Treatment Regimes // Dynamic
		treatment regimens (DTRs) are sequential decision rules
		tailored at each stage by time-varying subject-specific
		features and intermediate outcomes observed in previous stages.
		This package implements three methods: O-learning (Zhao et. al.
		2012,2014), Q-learning (Murphy et. al. 2007; Zhao et.al. 2009)
		and P-learning (Liu et. al. 2014, 2015) to estimate the optimal
		DTRs.
