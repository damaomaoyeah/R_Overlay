		'vcd' Extensions and Additions // Provides additional data sets,
		methods and documentation to complement the 'vcd' package for
		Visualizing Categorical Data and the 'gnm' package for
		Generalized Nonlinear Models. In particular, 'vcdExtra' extends
		mosaic, assoc and sieve plots from 'vcd' to handle 'glm()' and
		'gnm()' models and adds a 3D version in 'mosaic3d'.
		Additionally, methods are provided for comparing and
		visualizing lists of 'glm' and 'loglm' objects. This package is
		now a support package for the book, "Discrete Data Analysis
		with R" by Michael Friendly and David Meyer.
