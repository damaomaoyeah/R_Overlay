		Date Functions for Swedish Cancer Data // Identify, convert and
		handle dates as used within the Swedish cancer register and
		associated cancer quality registers in Sweden. Especially the
		cancer register sometimes use nonstandard date variables where
		day and/or month can be "00" or were the date format is a
		mixture of"%Y-%m-%d", "%Y%m%d" and "%y%V" (two digit year and
		week number according to ISO 8601,which is not completely
		supported by R).These dates must be approximated to valid dates
		before being used in for example survival analysis. The package
		also includes some convenient functions for calculating "lead
		times" (relying on 'difftime') and introduce a "year" class
		with relevant S3-methods to handle yearly cohort.
