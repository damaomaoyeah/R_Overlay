		Methods for accessing huge amounts of data [DEPRECATED] // THIS
		PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects
		based on it. Cross-platform alternatives are the following
		packages: bigmemory (CRAN), ff (CRAN), BufferedMatrix
		(Bioconductor).  The main usage of it was inside the
		aroma.affymetrix package. (The package currently provides a
		class representing a matrix where the actual data is stored in
		a binary format on the local file system.  This way the size
		limit of the data is set by the file system and not the
		memory.)
