		Simultaneous simulation of Q and R mode factor analyses with
		Spatial data // The qrfactor package simultaneously runs both Q
		and R  mode factor analyses. The package contains only one
		function called qrfactor() that can perform PCA, R-mode Factor
		Analysis, Q-mode Factor Analysis, Simultaneous R- and Q-mode
		Factor Analysis, Principal Coordinate Analysis, as wells as
		Multidimensional Scaling  (MDS). Loadings and scores can easily
		be computed from the  simulation.The plot.qrfactor() function
		offers several annotated  biplots for all possible combinations
		of eigenvectors, loadings, and scores. Input data includes
		shapefiles, tables and dataframe
