		Distribution and Equation // The DnE package involves functions
		to analyse the distribution of a set of given data. The basic
		idea of the analysis is chi-squared test. Functions which have
		the form as "is.xxdistribution" are used to analyse whether the
		data obeys the xxdistrbution. If you do not know which
		distribution to judge, use function is.dt().
