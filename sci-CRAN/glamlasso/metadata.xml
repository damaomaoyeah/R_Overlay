		Penalization in Large Scale Generalized Linear Array Models //
		Efficient design matrix free procedure for penalized estimation
		in large scale 2 and 3-dimensional generalized linear array
		models. Currently either Lasso or SCAD penalized estimation is
		possible for the followings models: The Gaussian model with
		identity link, the Binomial model with logit link, the Poisson
		model with log link and the Gamma model with log link.
