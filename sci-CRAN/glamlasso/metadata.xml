		Lasso Penalization in Large Scale Generalized Linear Array Models
		// Efficient design matrix free procedure for Lasso regularized
		estimation in large scale 3-dimensional generalized linear
		array models. The Gaussian model with identity link, the
		Binomial model with logit link, the Poisson model with log link
		and the Gamma model with log link is currently implemented.
