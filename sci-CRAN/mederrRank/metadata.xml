		Bayesian Methods for Identifying the Most Harmful Medication
		Errors // This package implements two distinct but related
		statistical approaches to the problem of identifying the
		combinations of medication error characteristics that are more
		likely to result in harm: 1) Bayesian hierarchical models with
		optimal Bayesian ranking on the log odds of harm, and 2) an
		empirical Bayes model that estimates the ratio of the observed
		count of harm to the count that would be expected if error
		characteristics and harm were independent. In addition, for the
		Bayesian hierarchical model, the package provides functions to
		assess the sensitivity of results to different specifications
		of the random effects distributions.
