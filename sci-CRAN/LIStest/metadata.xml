		Tests of independence based on the Longest Increasing Subsequence
		// Tests for independence between X and Y computed from a
		paired sample (x1,y1),...(xn,yn) of (X,Y), using one of the
		following statistics (a) the Longest Increasing Subsequence
		(Ln), (b) JLn, a Jackknife version of Ln or (c) JLMn, a
		Jackknife version of the longest monotonic subsequence. This
		family of tests can be applied under the assumption of
		continuity of X and Y.
