		Type-Specific Failure Rate and Hazard Rate on Competing Risks
		Data // Given a failure type, the function computes covariate-
		specific probability of failure over time and covariate-
		specific conditional hazard rate based on possibly right-
		censored competing risk data. Specifically, it computes the
		non-parametric maximum-likelihood estimates of these quantities
		and their asymptotic variances in a semi-parametric mixture
		model for competing-risks data, as described in Chang et al.
		(2007a).
