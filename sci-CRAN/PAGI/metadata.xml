		The package can identify the dysregulated KEGG pathways based on
		global influence from the internal effect of pathways and
		crosstalk between pathways. // The package can identify the
		dysregulated KEGG pathways based on global influence from the
		internal effect of pathways and crosstalk between pathways. (1)
		The PAGI package can prioritize the pathways associated with
		two biological states by statistical significance or FDR. (2)
		The PAGI package can evaluated the global influence factor
		(GIF) score in the global gene-gene network constructed based
		on the relationships of genes extracted from each pathway in
		KEGG database and the overlapped genes between pathways.
