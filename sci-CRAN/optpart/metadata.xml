		Optimal partitioning of similarity relations // The package
		contains a set of algorithms for creating partitions and
		coverings of objects largely based on operations on
		(dis)similarity relations (or matrices). There are several
		iterative re-assignment algorithms optimizing different
		goodness-of-clustering criteria.  In addition, there are
		covering algorithms 'clique' which derives maximal cliques, and
		'maxpact' which creates a covering of maximally compact sets.
		Graphical analyses and conversion routines are also included.
