		Improved False Positive Control of Gene-Permuting GSEA with
		Absolute Filtering // Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is
		popularly used to assess the enrichment of differential signal
		in a pre-defined gene-set without using a cutoff threshold for
		differential expression. The significance of enrichment is
		evaluated through sample- or gene-permutation method. Although
		the sample-permutation approach is highly recommended due to
		its good false positive control, we must use gene-permuting
		method if the number of samples is small. However, such gene-
		permuting GSEA (or preranked GSEA) generates a lot of false
		positive gene-sets as the inter-gene correlation in each gene
		set increases. These false positives can be successfully
		reduced by filtering with the one-tailed absolute GSEA results.
		This package provides a function that performs gene-permuting
		GSEA calculation with or without the absolute filtering.
		Without filtering, users can perform (original) two-tailed or
		one-tailed absolute GSEA.
