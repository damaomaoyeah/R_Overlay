		Generalized Correlations and Initial Causal Path // Asymmetric
		generalized correlations r*(x|y) measure strength of the
		dependence of x on y. If |r*(x|y)| |r*(y|x)| it suggests that y
		is more likely the "kernel cause" of x. There are at least two
		additional ways of comparing two kernel regressions helping
		identify the `cause'. In simultaneous equation models where
		endogeneity of regressors is feared, we can use Prof. Koopmans'
		method to ignore endogeneity problems when it kernel causes the
		dependent variable. The usual partial correlations can be
		generalized for the asymmetric matrix of r*'s. Partial
		correlations help asses effect of x on y after removing the
		effect of a set of variables. The package provides additional
		tools for causal assessment, for printing the causal detections
		in a clear, comprehensive compact summary form, for matrix
		algebra, for outlier detection, and for numerical integration
		by the trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance, etc. The package
		has a function for bootstrap-based statistical inference and
		one for a heuristic t-test.
