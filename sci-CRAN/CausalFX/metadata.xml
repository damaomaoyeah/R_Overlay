		Methods for Estimating Causal Effects from Observational Data //
		Estimate causal effects of one variable on another, currently
		for binary data only. Methods include instrumental variable
		bounds, adjustment by a given covariate set, adjustment by an
		induced covariate set using a variation of the PC algorithm,
		and an effect bounding method (the Witness Protection Program)
		based on covariate adjustment with observable independence
		constraints.
