		Compute the NPMLE of distribution from doubly censored data //
		Use EM algorithm to compute the NPMLE of CDF and also the two
		censoring distributions. For doubly censored data (as described
		in Chang and Yang (1987) Ann. Stat. 1536-47). You can also
		specify a constraint, it will return the constrained NPMLE and
		the -2 log empirical likelihood ratio. This can be used to test
		the hypothesis about the constraint and find confidence
		intervals for probability or quantile via empirical likelihood
		ratio theorem. Influence function of hat F may also be
		calculated (but may be slow).
