		funreg (Functional Regression for Irregularly Timed Data) // This
		package performs functional regression, and some related
		approaches, for intensive longitudinal data (see Walls
		Schafer, 2006) which is not necessarily observed on an equally
		spaced grid of times.  The approach generally follows the ideas
		of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu, Caffo, and Reich (2011) and
		the approach taken in their sample code, but with some
		modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather
		than wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal
		and potentially random measurement times.  It also allows easy
		plotting of the correlation between the smoothed covariate and
		the outcome as a function of time, which can add additional
		insights on how to interpret a functional regression.
		Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for
		the significance of the functional predictor.  The heuristic
		interpretation of ``time'' is used to describe the index of the
		functional predictor, but the same methods can equally be used
		for another unidimensional continuous index, such as space
		along a north-south axis.  The development of this package was
		part of a research project supported by Award R03 CA171809-01
		from the National Cancer Institute and Award P50 DA010075 from
		the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The content is solely the
		responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily
