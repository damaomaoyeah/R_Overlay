		A tool for the design of synthetic experiments in machine
		olfaction. // This package introduces a software tool for the
		design of synthetic experiments in machine olfaction. The
		generator of gas sensor signals can be used in applications
		related to test and benchmarking of signal processing methods,
		neuromorphic simulations in machine olfaction and educational
		tools. A so-called virtual sensor array features unlimited
		number of sensors, support of multicomponent gas mixtures and
		full parametric control of the noise in the system. The
		artificial (virtual) sensor array is inspired from a reference
		database of seventeen polymeric sensors with concentration
		profiles for three analytes.
