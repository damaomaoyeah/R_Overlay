		Efficient mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated designs //
		mxkssd is a package that generates efficient balanced mixed-
		level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging the
		elements of the generator vector. The package tries to generate
		a supersaturated design that has EfNOD efficiency more than
		user specified efficiency level (mef). The package also
		displays the progress of generation of an efficient mixed-level
		k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress of 100
		per cent means that one full round of interchange is completed.
		More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange
		may be required for larger designs.
