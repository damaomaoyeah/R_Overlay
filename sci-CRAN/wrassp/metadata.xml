		Interface to the ASSP Library // wrassp is a wrapper around
		Michel Scheffers's libassp (Advanced Speech Signal Processor).
		The libassp library aims at providing functionality for
		handling speech signal files in most common audio formats and
		for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech
		science. This includes the calculation of formants, fundamental
		frequency, root mean square, auto correlation, a variety of
		spectral analyses, zero crossing rate, filtering etc. This
		wrapper provides R with a large subset of libassp's signal
		processing functions and provides them to the user in a
		(hopefully) user-friendly manner.
