		Delete or Merge Regressors for linear model selection. // A
		backward selection procedure called delete or merge regressors
		(DMR) combines deleting continuous variables with merging
		levels of factors. The method assumes greedy search among
		linear models with set of constraints of two types: either a
		parameter for a continuous variable is set to zero or
		parameters corresponding to two levels of a factor are
		compared. DMR is a stepwise regression procedure, where in each
		step a new constraint is added according to ranking of the
		hypotheses based on squared t-statistics. As a result a nested
		family of linear models is obtained and the final decision is
		made according to minimization of the generalized information
		criterion (GIC, default BIC). The main function of the package
		is DMR, which is based on hierarchical clustering. Moreover,
		other functions for extensions of DMR method are given, such as
		stepDMR which is based on recalculation of t-statistics in each
		step and function DMR4glm for generalized linear models.
