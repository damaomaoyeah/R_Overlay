		Calculates Likelihood Support Intervals for Common Data Types //
		Calculates likelihood based support intervals for several
		common data types including binomial, Poisson, normal, lm(),
		and glm(). For the binomial, Poisson, and normal data
		likelihood intervals are calculated via root finding algorithm.
		Additional parameters allow the user to specify whether they
		would like to receive a parametric bootstrap estimate of the
		confidence level of said support interval. For lm() and glm(),
		the function returns profile likelihoods for each coefficient
		in the model.
