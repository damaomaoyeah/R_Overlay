		Simple Variable Treatment // Prepares variables so that data has
		fewer exceptional cases, making it easier to safely use models
		in production. Common problems 'vtreat' defends against: Inf,
		NA, too many categorical values, rare categorical values, new
		categorical values (levels seen during application, but not
		during training).   'vtreat::prepare' should be used as you
		would use 'model.matrix'.
