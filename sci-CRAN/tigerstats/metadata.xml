		R Functions for Elementary Statistics // A collection of data
		sets and functions that are useful in the teaching of
		statistics at an elementary level to students who may have
		little or no previous experience with the command line.  The
		functions for elementary inferential procedures follow a
		uniform interface for user input.  Some of the functions are
		instructional applets that can only be run on the R Studio
		integrated development environment with package 'manipulate'
		attached. R Studio is freely available (www.rstudio.org), and
		includes package 'manipulate'.  Other instructional applets are
		Shiny apps that may be run locally. In teaching the package is
		used alongside of package 'mosaic', 'mosaicData' and 'abd',
		which are therefore listed as dependencies.
