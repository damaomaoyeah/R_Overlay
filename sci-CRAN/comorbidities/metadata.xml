		Categorizes ICD-9-CM codes based on published comorbidity indices
		// Methods to categorize ICD-9-CM codes into sensible disease
		categories have been developed and published by numerous
		authors.  Two of the most widely used such methods are the Deyo
		adaptation of the Charlson index and the Elixhauser index. This
		package has functions to categorize comorbidites into the Deyo-
		Charlson index, the original Elixhauser index of 30
		comorbidities, and the AHRQ comorbidity index of 29 diagnoses
		(an update to the original Elixhauser method).
