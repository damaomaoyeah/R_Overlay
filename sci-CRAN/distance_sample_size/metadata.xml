		Calculates Study Size Required for Distance Sampling //
		Calculates the study size (either number of detections, or
		proportion of region that should be covered) to achieve a
		target precision for the estimated abundance. The calculation
		allows for the penalty due to unknown detection function, and
		for overdispersion. The user must specify a guess at the true
		detection function.
