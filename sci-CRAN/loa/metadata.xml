		Various Options and Add-ins for Lattice // This package, Lattice
		Options and Add-ins (or loa), contains various plots and
		functions that make use of the lattice/trellis plotting
		framework. The plots (which include loaPlot, GoogleMap and
		trianglePlot) use panelPal, a function that extends lattice and
		hexbin package methods to automate plot subscripting and panel-
		to-panel and panel-to key synchronization/management. See ?loa
		for further details.
