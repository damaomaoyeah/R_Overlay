		Parallel Constraint Satisfaction Networks in R // Parallel
		Constraint Satisfaction (PCS) models are an increasingly common
		class of models in Psychology, with applications to reading and
		word recognition (McClelland  Rumelhart, 1981), judgment and
		decision making (Glckner  Betsch, 2008; Glckner, Hilbig,
		Jekel, 2014), and several other fields (e.g. Read, Vanman,
		Miller, 1997). In each of these fields, they provide a
		quantitative model of psychological phenomena, with precise
		predictions regarding choice probabilities, decision times, and
		often the degree of confidence. This package provides the
		necessary functions to create and simulate basic Parallel
		Constraint Satisfaction networks within R.
