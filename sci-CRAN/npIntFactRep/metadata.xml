		Nonparametric Interaction Tests for Factorial Designs with
		Repeated Measures // Returns nonparametric aligned rank tests
		for the interaction in two-way factorial designs, on R data
		sets with repeated measures in 'wide' format. Five ANOVAs
		tables are reported. A PARAMETRIC one on the original data, one
		for a CHECK upon the interaction alignments, and three aligned
		rank tests: one on the aligned REGULAR, one on the FRIEDMAN,
		and one on the KOCH ranks. In these rank tests, only the
		resulting values for the interaction are relevant.
