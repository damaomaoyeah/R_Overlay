		Nonparametric Comparison of Multivariate Samples // Performs
		analysis of one-way multivariate data, for small samples using
		Nonparametric techniques. Using approximations for ANOVA Type,
		Wilks' Lambda, Lawley Hotelling, and Bartlett Nanda Pillai Test
		statics, the package compares the multivariate distributions
		for a single explanatory variable.  The comparison is also
		performed using a permutation test for each of the four test
		statistics. The package also performs an all-subsets algorithm
		regarding variables and regarding factor levels.
