		Continuous Optimization using Memetic Algorithms with Local
		Search Chains (MA-LS-Chains) in R // An implementation of an
		algorithm family for continuous optimization called memetic
		algorithms with local search chains (MA-LS-Chains). Memetic
		algorithms are hybridizations of genetic algorithms with local
		search methods. They are especially suited for continuous
		optimization.
