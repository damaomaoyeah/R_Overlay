		High-Dimensional Kernel Density Estimation and Geometry
		Operations // Estimates the shape and volume of high-
		dimensional datasets and performs set operations: intersection
		/ overlap, union, unique components, inclusion test, and hole
		detection. Uses stochastic geometry approach to high-
		dimensional kernel density estimation. Builds n-dimensional
		convex hulls (polytopes). Can measure the n-dimensional
		ecological hypervolume and perform species distribution
		modeling.
