		Measures of Risk for the Compound Poisson Risk Process with
		Diffusion // Based on the compound Poisson risk process that is
		perturbed by a Brownian motion, saddlepoint approximations to
		some measures of risk are provided. Various approximation
		methods for the probability of ruin are also included.
		Furthermore, exact values of both the risk measures as well as
		the probability of ruin are available if the individual claims
		follow a hypo-exponential distribution (i. e., if it can be
		represented as a sum of independent exponentially distributed
		random variables with different rate parameters). For more
		details see Gatto and Baumgartner (2014)
