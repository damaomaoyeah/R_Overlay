		Measures of Risk for the Compound Poisson Risk Process with
		Diffusion // The main purpose of this package is to provide
		saddlepoint approximations to some measures of risk, based on
		the compound Poisson risk process that is perturbed by a
		Brownian motion.  Various approximation methods for the
		probability of ruin are also included.  Furthermore, exact
		values of both the risk measures as well as the probability of
		ruin are available if the individual claims follow a hypo-
		exponential distribution (i. e., if it can be represented as a
		sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables
		with different rate parameters).
