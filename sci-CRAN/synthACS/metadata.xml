		Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS
		Data // Firstly provides a wrapper to library(acs) to access
		curated set of American Community Survey (ACS) base tables
		which may be of interest to many researchers. Secondly, it
		builds synthetic micro-datasets of ACS data at any specified
		geographic level with 10 default individual attributes.
		Thirdly, provides functionality for data-extensibility of
		micro-datasets; allowing users to both add data attributes and
		marginalize undesired attributes. And finally, the package also
		conducts spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM) via simulated
		annealing.  SMSM is conducted in parallel by default.
