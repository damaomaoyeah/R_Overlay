		Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS
		Data // Firstly provides a wrapper to library(acs) to access
		numerous American Community Survey (ACS) base tables which may
		be of interest to many researchers. Secondly, it builds
		synthetic micro-datasets of ACS data at any specified
		geographic level with 10 default individual attributes.
		Thirdly, the package provides functionality for users to add
		additional ACS  non-ACS  data attributes to micro-datasets
		based on macro population characteristics. And finally, the
		package also conducts spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM)
		via simulated annealing.  SMSM is conducted in parallel by
		default.
