		High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation // The package
		"huge" provides a general framework for high-dimensional
		undirected graph estimation. It integrates data preprocessing,
		neighborhood screening, graph estimation, and model selection
		techniques into a pipeline. In preprocessing stage, the
		nonparanormal(npn) transformation is applied to help relax the
		normality assumption. In the graph estimation stage, the graph
		structure is estimated by Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation
		or the graphical lasso, and both methods can be further
		accelerated by the lossy screening rule preselecting the
		neighborhood of each variable by correlation thresholding. We
		target on high-dimensional data analysis usually d  n, and the
		computation is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output.
		We also provide a computationally efficient approach,
		correlation thresholding graph estimation. Three
		regularization/thresholding parameter selection methods are
		included in this package: (1)stability approach for
		regularization selection (2) rotation information criterion (3)
		extended Bayesian information criterion which is only available
		for the graphical lasso.
