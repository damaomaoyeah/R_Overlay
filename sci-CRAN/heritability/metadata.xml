		Marker-Based Estimation of Heritability Using Individual Plant or
		Plot Data // Implements marker-based estimation of heritability
		when observations on genetically identical replicates are
		available. These can be either observations on individual
		plants or plot-level data in a field trial. Heritability can
		then be estimated using a mixed model for the individual plant
		or plot data. For comparison, also mixed-model based estimation
		using genotypic means and estimation of repeatability with
		ANOVA are implemented. For illustration the package contains
		several datasets for the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.
