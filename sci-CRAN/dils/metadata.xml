		Data-Informed Link Strength. Combine multiple-relationship
		networks into a single weighted network. Impute (fill-in)
		missing network links. // Combine multiple-relationship
		networks into a single weighted network.  The approach is
		similar to factor analysis in the that contribution from each
		constituent network varies so as to maximize the information
		gleaned from the multiple-relationship networks. This
		implementation uses Principal Component Analysis calculated
		using 'prcomp' with bootstrap subsampling.  Missing links are
		imputed using the method of Chen et al. (2012).
