		Data Mangement for Hydrology and Beyond Using the Observations
		Data Model // Data management in hydrology and other fields is
		facilitated with functions to enter and modify data in a
		database according to the Observations Data Model (ODM)
		standard by CUASHI (Consortium of Universities for the
		Advancement of Hydrologic Science). While this data model has
		been developed in hydrology, it is also useful for other
		fields. RObsDat helps in the setup of the database within one
		of the free database systems MariaDB, PostgreSQL or SQLite. It
		imports the controlled water vocabulary from the CUASHI web
		service and provides a smart interface between the analyst and
		the database: Already existing data entries are detected and
		duplicates avoided. The data import function converts different
		data table designs to make import simple. Cleaning and
		modifications of data are handled with a simple version control
		system. Variable and location names are treated in a user
		friendly way, accepting and processing multiple versions. When
		querying data from the database, it is stored in a spacetime
		objects within R for subsequent processing.
