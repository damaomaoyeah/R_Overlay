		Simple interactive controls for R using the tcltk library. //
		rpanel provides a set of functions to build simple GUI controls
		for R functions.  These are built on the tcltk package. Uses
		could include changing a parameter on a graph by animating it
		with a slider or a "doublebutton", up to more sophisticated
		control panels. Some functions for specific graphical tasks,
		referred to as 'cartoons', are provided.
