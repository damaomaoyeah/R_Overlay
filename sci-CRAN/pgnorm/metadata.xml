		The p-generalized normal distribution // Evaluation of the pdf
		and the cdf of the univariate p-generalized normal
		distribution. Sampling from the p-generalized normal
		distribution using either the p-generalized polar method, the
		p-generalized rejecting polar method, the Monty Python method,
		the Ziggurat method or the method of Nardon and Pianca. The
		package also includes routines for the simulation of the
		bivariate, p-generalized uniform distribution on the
		p-generalized unit circle and the simulation of the
		corresponding angular distribution.
