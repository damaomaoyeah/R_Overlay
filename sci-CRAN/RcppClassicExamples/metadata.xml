		Examples using RcppClassic to interface R and C++ // The Rcpp
		package contains a C++ library that facilitates the integration
		of R and C++ in various ways via a rich API. This API was
		preceded by an earlier version which has been deprecated since
		2010 (but is still supported to provide backwards compatability
		in the package RcppClassic).  This package RcppClassicExamples
		provides usage examples for the older, deprecated API. There is
		also a corresponding package RcppExamples package with examples
		for the newer, current API which we strongly recommend as the
		basis for all new development.
