		Differentially Private Regularized Logistic Regression //
		PrivateLR implements two differentially private algorithms for
		estimating L2-regularized logistic regression coefficients. A
		randomized algorithm F is epsilon-differentially private (C.
		Dwork, Differential Privacy, ICALP 2006), if |log(P(F(D) in S))
		- log(P(F(D') in S))| = epsilon for any pair D, D' of datasets
		that differ in exactly one element, any set S, and the
		randomness is taken over the choices F makes.
