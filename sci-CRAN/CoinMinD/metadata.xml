		Simultaneous Confidence Interval for Multinomial Proportion //
		Methods for obtaining simultaneous confidence interval for
		multinomial proportion have been proposed by many authors and
		the present study include a variety of widely applicable
		procedures. Seven classical methods (Wilson, Quesenberry and
		Hurst, Goodman, Wald with and without continuity correction,
		Fitzpatrick and Scott, Sison and Glaz) and Bayesian Dirichlet
		models are included in the package. The advantage of MCMC pack
		has been exploited to derive the Dirichlet posterior directly
		and this also helps in handling the Dirichlet prior parameters.
		This package is prepared to have equal and unequal values for
		the Dirichlet prior distribution that will provide better scope
		for data analysis and associated sensitivity analysis.
