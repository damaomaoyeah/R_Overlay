		Group Factor Analysis // Factor analysis implementation for
		multiple data sources, i.e., for groups of variables. The whole
		data analysis pipeline is provided, including functions and
		recommendations for data normalization and model definition, as
		well as missing value prediction and model visualization. The
		model group factor analysis (GFA) is inferred with Gibbs
		sampling, and it has been presented originally by Virtanen et
		al. (2012), and extended in Klami et al. (2015)
		DOI:10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2376974 and Bunte et al. (2016)
		DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw207; for details, see the
		citation info.
