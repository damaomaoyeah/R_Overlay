		Hierarchical Multiplicative Partitioning of Complex Phenotypes //
		Hierarchical group-wise partitioning of phenotypic diversity
		into within-group (alpha), among-group (beta), and pooled-total
		(gamma) components using Hill numbers. Turnover and overlap are
		also calculated as standardized alternatives to beta diversity.
		Hierarchical bootstrapping is used to approximate uncertainty
		around each diversity component.
