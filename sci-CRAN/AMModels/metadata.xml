		Adaptive Management Model Manager // Helps enable adaptive
		management by codifying knowledge in the form of models
		generated from numerous analyses and data sets. Facilitates
		this process by storing all models and data sets in a single
		object that can be updated and saved, thus tracking changes in
		knowledge through time. A shiny application called AM Model
		Manager (modelMgr()) enables the use of these functions via a
		GUI.
