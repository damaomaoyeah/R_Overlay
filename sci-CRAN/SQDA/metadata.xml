		Sparse Quadratic Discriminant Analysis // Sparse Quadratic
		Discriminant Analysis (SQDA) can be performed. In SQDA, the
		covariance matrix are assumed to be block-diagonal.And, for
		each block, sparsity assumption is imposed on the covariance
		matrix. It is useful in high-dimensional setting.
