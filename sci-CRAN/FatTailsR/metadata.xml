		Kiener Distributions and Fat Tails in Finance // Kiener
		distributions K1, K2, K3 and K4 to characterize distributions
		with left and right, symmetric or asymmetric fat tails in
		market finance, neuroscience and other disciplines. Two
		algorithms to estimate with a high accuracy distribution
		parameters, quantiles, value-at-risk and expected shortfall.
		Also, power hyperbolas and power hyperbolic functions. Some
		functions introduced in v1.2-0 were suppressed.
