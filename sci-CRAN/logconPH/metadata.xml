		CoxPH Model with Log Concave Baseline Distribution // Computes a
		cox PH model with a log concave baseline distribution. If no
		covariates are provided, estimates the log concave NPMLE. Built
		specifically for interval censored data, where data is a n by 2
		matrix with [i, 1] as the left side of the interval for subject
		i and [i,2] as right side. Uncensored data can be entered by
		setting [i,1] = [i,2]. Alternatively, this can also handle
		uncensored data. If all the data is uncensored, you may enter
		data as a length(n) vector.
