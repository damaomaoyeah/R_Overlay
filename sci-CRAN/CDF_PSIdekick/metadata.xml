		Evaluate Differentially Private Algorithms for Publishing
		Cumulative Distribution Functions // Designed by and for the
		community of differential privacy algorithm developers. It can
		be used to empirically evaluate and visualize Cumulative
		Distribution Functions incorporating noise that satisfies
		differential privacy, with numerous options made to streamline
		collection of utility measurements across variations of key
		parameters, such as epsilon, domain size, sample size, data
		shape, etc. Developed by researchers at Harvard PSI.
