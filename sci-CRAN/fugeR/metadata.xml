		FUzzy GEnetic, a machine learning algorithm to construct
		prediction model based on fuzzy logic. // This is an
		evolutionary algorithm for fuzzy systems, a genetic algorithm
		is used to construct a fuzzy system able to fit the given
		training data.  This fuzzy system can then be used as a
		prediction model, it's composed of fuzzy logic rules that
		provide a good lingustic representation.
