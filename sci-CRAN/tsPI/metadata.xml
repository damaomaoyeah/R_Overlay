		Improved Prediction Intervals for ARIMA Processes and Structural
		Time Series // Prediction intervals for ARIMA and structural
		time series models using importance sampling approach with
		uninformative priors for model parameters, leading to more
		accurate coverage probabilities in frequentist sense. Instead
		of sampling the future observations and hidden states of the
		state space representation of the model, only model parameters
		are sampled, and the method is based solving the equations
		corresponding to the conditional coverage probability of the
		prediction intervals. This makes method relatively fast
		compared to for example MCMC methods, and standard errors of
		prediction limits can also be computed straightforwardly.
