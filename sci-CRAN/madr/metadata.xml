		Model Averaged Double Robust Estimation // Estimates average
		treatment effects using model average double robust (MA-DR)
		estimation. The MA-DR estimator is defined as weighted average
		of double robust estimators, where each double robust estimator
		corresponds to a specific choice of the outcome model and the
		propensity score model. The MA-DR estimator extend the
		desirable double robustness property by achieving consistency
		under the much weaker assumption that either the true
		propensity score model or the true outcome model be within a
		specified, possibly large, class of models.
