		Causal Mediation Analysis // We implement parametric and non
		parametric mediation analysis. This package performs the
		methods and suggestions in Imai, Keele and Yamamoto (2010),
		Imai, Keele and Tingley (2010), Imai, Tingley and Yamamoto
		(2013), Imai and Yamamoto (2013) and Yamamoto (2013). In
		addition to the estimation of causal mediation effects, the
		software also allows researchers to conduct sensitivity
		analysis for certain parametric models.
