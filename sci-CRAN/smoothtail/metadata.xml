		Smooth Estimation of GPD Shape Parameter // Given independent and
		identically distributed observations X(1), ..., X(n) from a
		Generalized Pareto distribution with shape parameter gamma in
		[-1,0], offers several estimates to compute estimates of gamma.
		The estimates are based on the principle of replacing the order
		statistics by quantiles of a distribution function based on a
		log--concave density function. This procedure is justified by
		the fact that the GPD density is log--concave for gamma in
		[-1,0].
