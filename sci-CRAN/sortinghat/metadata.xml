		sortinghat // sortinghat is a classification framework to
		streamline the evaluation of classifiers (classification models
		and algorithms) and seeks to determine the best classifiers on
		a variety of simulated and benchmark data sets. Several error-
		rate estimators are included to evaluate the performance of a
		classifier. This package is intended to complement the well-
		known 'caret' package.
