		Evaluation of Diversity in Nucleotide Libraries // Evaluation of
		diversity in peptide libraries, including NNN, NNB, NNK/S, and
		20/20 schemes. Custom encoding schemes can also be defined.
		Metrics for evaluation include expected coverage, relative
		efficiency, and the functional diversity of the library.
		Peptide-level inclusion probabilities are computable for both
		the native and custom encoding schemes.
