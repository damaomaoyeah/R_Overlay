		Nested and Crossed Block Designs for Unstructured and Factorial
		Treatment Sets // Constructs randomized nested or crossed block
		designs for unstructured treatment sets or for factorial
		treatments sets. Where the treatments are factorial, the
		treatments model can be defined by using the model formulation
		defined in the model.matrix {stats} base package. Blocks are
		nested hierarchically in successive blocks strata and the
		blocks model in any particular stratum can comprise either a
		simple nested blocks design or a crossed row-and-column design.
		Block sizes in any one stratum are either all equal or differ,
		at most, by one plot. The design outputs include a data frame
		showing the allocation of treatments to blocks, a table showing
		block levels, the achieved D-efficiency, the achieved
		A-efficiency (unstructured treatments only) and A-efficiency
		upper bounds, where available, for each stratum in the design.
		For designs with simple unstructured treatments, a plan layout
		showing the allocation of treatments to blocks or to rows and
		columns in the bottom stratum of the design is also given.
