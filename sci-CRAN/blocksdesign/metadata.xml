		Nested Block Designs for Unstructured Treatments // Constructs
		nested and crossed block designs for unstructured treatment
		sets with arbitrary replication not necessarily all equal.
		Blocks can be nested to any required depth of nesting and
		blocks are optimized hierarchically from the top down with
		successive nested blocks strata optimized within the levels of
		all preceding blocks strata. Block sizes are all equal in any
		one stratum if the number of blocks in that stratum exactly
		divides the number of plots, otherwise they differ by at most
		one plot. The design output is a data table showing a
		randomised allocation of treatments to blocks together with
		plans showing the allocation of treatments to blocks for each
		block in the bottom stratum of the design. D and A-efficiency
		factors are shown for each stratum together with A-efficiency
		upper bounds, where available.
