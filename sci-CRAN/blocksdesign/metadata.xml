		Nested Block Designs for Unstructured Treatments // Nested block
		designs for unstructured treatment sets where blocks can be
		repeatedly nested and treatments can have different levels of
		replication. Blocks are optimized hierarchically from the top
		down with each set of nested blocks optimized within the levels
		of any existing higher-level blocks. Block sizes are equal if
		the number of blocks exactly divides the number of plots,
		otherwise they differ by at most one plot. The design output is
		a data table giving a randomised allocation of treatments to
		blocks together with a plan table showing treatments in blocks
		and a set of blocks-by-treatments incidence matrices, one for
		each blocks stratum.
