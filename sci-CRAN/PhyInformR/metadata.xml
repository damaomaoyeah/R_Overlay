		Rapid Calculation of Phylogenetic Information Content // Enables
		rapid calculation of phylogenetic information content using the
		latest advances in phylogenetic informativeness based theory.
		These advances include modifications that incorporate uneven
		branch lengths and any model of nucleotide substitution to
		provide assessments of the phylogenetic utility of any given
		dataset or dataset partition. Also provides new tools for data
		visualization and routines optimized for rapid statistical
		calculations, including approaches making use of Bayesian
		posterior distributions and parallel processing. Users can
		apply these approaches toward screening datasets for
		phylogenetic/genomic information content.
