		Dynamic Panel Models with Orthogonal Reparameterization of Fixed
		Effects // Implements the orthogonal reparameterization
		approach recommended by Lancaster (2002) to estimate dynamic
		panel models with fixed effects (and optionally: panel specific
		intercepts). The approach uses a likelihood-based estimator and
		produces estimates that are asymptotically unbiased as N goes
		to infinity, with a T as low as 2.
