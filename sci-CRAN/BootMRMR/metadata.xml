		Bootstrap-MRMR Technique for Informative Gene Selection //
		Selection of informative features like genes, transcripts, RNA
		seq, etc. using Bootstrap Maximum Relevance and Minimum
		Redundancy technique from a given high dimensional genomic
		dataset. Informative gene selection involves identification of
		relevant genes and removal of redundant genes as much as
		possible from a large gene space. Main applications in high-
		dimensional expression data analysis (e.g. microarray data, NGS
		expression data and other genomics and proteomics
		applications).
