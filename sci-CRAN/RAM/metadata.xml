		R for Amplicon-based Metagenomics // This package provides a
		series of functions to make amplicon-based metagenomic analysis
		more accessible, and publication-quality plots simple.
		Amplicon-based (or targeted) metagenomics amplifies and
		sequences selected DNA regions of environmental samples, but
		not the entire pool of genetic material, which is referred to
		as shotgun metagenomics. The amplicon-metagenomics mainly aims
		at characterizing broad microbiota biodiversity in different
		environments.
