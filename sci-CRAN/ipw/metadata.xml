		Estimate Inverse Probability Weights // Functions to estimate the
		probability to receive the observed treatment, based on
		individual characteristics. The inverse of these probabilities
		can be used as weights when estimating causal effects from
		observational data via marginal structural models. Both point
		treatment situations and longitudinal studies can be analysed.
		The same functions can be used to correct for informative
		censoring.
