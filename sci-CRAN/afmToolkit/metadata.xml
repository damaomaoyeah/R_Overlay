		Functions for Atomic Force Microscope Force-Distance Curves
		Analysis // Set of functions for analyzing Atomic Force
		Microscope (AFM) force-distance curves. It allows to obtain the
		contact and unbinding points, perform the baseline correction,
		estimate the Young's modulus, fit up to two exponential decay
		function to a stress-relaxation / creep experiment, obtain
		adhesion energies. These operations can be done either over a
		single F-d curve or over a set of F-d curves in batch  mode.
