		A mocking, stubbing, and file testing framework extending
		testthat // This package intends to go above and beyond of the
		features provided by the testthat package. Namely, stubbing of
		functions and methods is provided as well as the ability to
		architect mock structured hierarchies of files (sometimes
		called fixtures). Intended for developers, testthatsomemore
		aims to raise the caliber of R testing frameworks to that of
		famous libraries like JUnit and RSpec.
