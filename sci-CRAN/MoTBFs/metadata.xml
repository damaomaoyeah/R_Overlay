		Learning Hybrid Bayesian Networks using Mixtures of Truncated
		Basis Functions // Learning, manipulation and  evaluation of
		mixtures of  truncated basis  functions (MoTBFs),  which
		include mixtures of  polynomials (MOPs) and  mixtures of
		truncated exponentials (MTEs). MoTBFs are a flexible framework
		for modelling hybrid Bayesian networks. The  package provides
		functionality for learning  univariate, multivariate and
		conditional  densities, with the  possibility of incorporating
		prior  knowledge. Structural learning of hybrid Bayesian
		networks is also provided. A set of useful tools is provided,
		including  plotting, printing  and likelihood  evaluation. This
		package  makes use of  S3 objects, with two new classes called
		'motbf' and 'jointmotbf'.
