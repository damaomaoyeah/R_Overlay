		Tools to Work with the Flexible Dirichlet Distribution //
		Provides tools to work with the Flexible Dirichlet
		distribution. The main features are an E-M algorithm for
		computing the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter
		vector and a function based on conditional bootstrap to
		estimate its asymptotic variance-covariance matrix. It contains
		also functions to plot graphs, to generate random observations
		and to handle compositional data.
