		Modelling Heterogeneity in Paired Comparison Data // Performs
		'BTLLasso', a method to model heterogeneity in paired
		comparison data. Subject-specific covariates are allowed to
		have an influence on the attractivity/strength of the objects.
		An L1 penalty on the pairwise differences between the object-
		specific parameters allows for both clustering of objects with
		regard to covariates and elimination of irrelevant covariates.
