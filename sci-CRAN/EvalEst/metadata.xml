		Dynamic Systems Estimation - Extensions // Provides functions for
		evaluating (time series) model estimation methods. These
		facilitate Monte Carlo experiments of repeated simulations and
		estimations. Also provides methods for looking at the
		distribution of the results from these experiments, including
		model roots (which are an equivalence class invariant).
