		RGCCA and Sparse GCCA for multi-block data analysis // Multi-
		block data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets of
		variables (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals.
		The main aims of the RGCCA package are: (i) to study the
		relationships between blocks and (ii) to identify subsets of
		variables of each block which are active in their relationships
		with the other blocks.
