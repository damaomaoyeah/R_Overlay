		Assessing Functional Impact on Gene Expression of Mutations in
		Cancer // A hierarchical Bayesian approach to assess functional
		impact of mutations on gene expression in cancer. Given a
		patient-gene matrix encoding the presence/absence of a
		mutation, a patient-gene expression matrix encoding continuous
		value expression data, and a graph structure encoding whether
		two genes are known to be functionally related, xseq outputs:
		a) the probability that a recurrently mutated gene g influences
		gene expression across the population of patients; and b) the
		probability that an individual mutation in gene g in an
		individual patient m influences expression within that patient.
