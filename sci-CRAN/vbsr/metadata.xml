		Variational Bayes Spike Regression Regularized Linear Models //
		Efficient algorithm for solving ultra-sparse regularized
		regression models using a variational Bayes algorithm with a
		spike (l0) prior.  Algorithm is solved on a path, with
		coordinate updates, and is capable of generating very sparse
		models.  There are very general model diagnostics for
		controling type-1 error included in this package.
