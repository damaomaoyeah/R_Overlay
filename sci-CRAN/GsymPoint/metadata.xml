		Estimation of the Generalized Symmetry Point, an Optimal Cutpoint
		in Continuous Diagnostic Tests // Estimation of the cutpoint
		defined by the Generalized Symmetry point in a binary
		classification setting based on a continuous diagnostic test or
		marker. Two methods have been implemented to construct
		confidence intervals for this optimal cutpoint, one based on
		the Generalized Pivotal Quantity and the other based on
		Empirical Likelihood. Numerical and graphical outputs for these
		two methods are easily obtained.
