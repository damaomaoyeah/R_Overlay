		Interface between HPCC and R // rHpcc is an R package providing
		an Interface between R and HPCC.Familiarity with ECL
		(Enterprise Control Language) is a must to use this
		package.HPCC is a massive parallel-processing computing
		platform that solves Big Data problems.ECL is the Enterprise
		Control Language designed specifically for huge data projects
		using the HPCC platform.Its extreme scalability comes from a
		design that allows you to leverage every query you create for
		re-use in subsequent queries as needed. To do this, ECL takes a
		dictionary approach to building queries wherein each ECL
		definition defines an Attribute. Each previously defined
		Attribute can then be used in succeeding ECL Attribute
		definitions as the language extends itself as you use it.
