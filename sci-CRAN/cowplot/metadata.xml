		Streamlined Plot Theme and Plot Annotations for 'ggplot2' // Some
		helpful extensions and modifications to the 'ggplot2' library.
		In particular, this package makes it easy to combine multiple
		'ggplot2' plots into one and label them with letters, e.g. A,
		B, C, etc., as is often required for scientific publications.
		The package also provides a streamlined and clean theme that is
		used in the Wilke lab, hence the package name, which stands for
		Claus O. Wilke's plot library.
