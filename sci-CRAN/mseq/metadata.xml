		Modeling non-uniformity in short-read rates in RNA-Seq data //
		This package implements all the methods in the paper "Modeling
		non-uniformity in short-read rates in RNA-Seq data".
		Especially, it implements both the iterative glm procedure for
		the Poisson linear model and the training procedure of the MART
		model. The cross-validation for both of the methods is also
		implemented. Version 1.1 and later also implements the Poisson
		linear model with dinucleotide composition. Version 1.2
		corrected a bug in expData.R. This bug leads to mis-labeled
		lines in plotCoef.R, but will not change other parts like
		training, testing, or cross-validation.
