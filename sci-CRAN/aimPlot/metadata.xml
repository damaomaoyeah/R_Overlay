		Create Pie Like Plot for Completeness // Create a pie like plot
		to visualise if the aim or several aims of a project is
		achieved or close to be achieved i.e the aim is achieved when
		the point is at the center of the pie plot. Imagine it's like a
		dartboard and the center means 100% completeness/achievement.
		Achievement can also be understood as 100% coverage. The
		standard distribution of completeness allocated in the pie plot
		is 50%, 80% and 100% completeness.
