		Minimum Distance Estimation in Autoregressive Model // Consider
		autoregressive model of order p where the distribution function
		of innovation is unknown, but innovations are independent and
		symmetrically distributed. The package contains a function
		named ARMDE which takes X (vector of n observations) and p
		(order of the model) as input argument and returns minimum
		distance estimator of the parameters in the model.
