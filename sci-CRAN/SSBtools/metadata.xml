		Statistics Norway's Miscellaneous Small Tools // Small functions
		used by other packages from Statistics Norway are gathered.
		Both general data manipulation functions and some more special
		functions for statistical disclosure control are included. One
		reason for a separate package is possible reuse of the
		functions within a Renjin environment.
