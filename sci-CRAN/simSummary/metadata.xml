		Simulation summary // simSummary is a small utility package which
		eases the process of summarizing simulation results.
		Simulations often produce intermediate results - some focal
		statistics that need to be summarized over several scenarios
		and many replications. This step is in principle easy, but
		tedious. The package simSummary fills this niche by providing a
		generic way of summarizing the focal statistics of simulations.
		The useR must provide properly structured input, holding focal
		statistics, and then the summary step can be performed with one
		line of code, calling the simSummary function.
