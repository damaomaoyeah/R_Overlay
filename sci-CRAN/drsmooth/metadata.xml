		Dose-Response Modeling with Smoothing Splines // Provides tools
		for assessing the shape of a dose-response curve by testing
		linearity and non-linearity at user-defined cut-offs. It also
		provides two methods of estimating a threshold dose, or the
		dose at which the dose-response function transitions to
		significantly increasing: bi-linear (based on pkg 'segmented')
		and smoothed with splines (based on pkg 'mgcv').
