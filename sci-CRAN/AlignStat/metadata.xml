		Comparison of Alternative Multiple Sequence Alignments // Methods
		for comparing two alternative multiple sequence alignments
		(MSAs) to determine whether they align homologous residues in
		the same columns as one another. It then classifies
		similarities and differences into conserved gaps, conserved
		sequence, merges, splits or shifts of one MSA relative to the
		other. Summarising these categories for each MSA column yields
		information on which sequence regions are agreed upon my both
		MSAs, and which differ. Several plotting functions enable
		easily visualisation of the comparison data for analysis.
