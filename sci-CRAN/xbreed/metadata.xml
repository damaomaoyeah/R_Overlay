		Simulation of purebred and crossbred genomic data as well as
		pedigree and phenotypes are possible by this package. 'xbreed'
		can be used for the simulation of populations with flexible
		genome structures and trait genetic architectures. It can also
		be used to evaluate breeding schemes and generate genetic data
