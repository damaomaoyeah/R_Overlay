		Analysis of Multiple Social Networks with Algebra // Algebraic
		procedures for the analysis of multiple social networks are
		delivered with this package. Among other things, it is possible
		to create and manipulate multivariate network data with
		different formats, and there are effective ways available to
		treat multiple networks with routines that combine algebraic
		systems like the partially ordered semigroup or the semiring
		structure together with the relational bundles occurring in
		different types of multivariate network data sets. As well an
		algebraic approach for two-mode networks is made through Galois
		derivations between families of the pair of subsets.
