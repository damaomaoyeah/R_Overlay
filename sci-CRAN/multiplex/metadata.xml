		Algebraic Tools for the Analysis of Multiple Social Networks //
		Algebraic procedures for the analysis of multiple social
		networks are delivered with this package. Among other things,
		it makes possible to create and manipulate multivariate network
		data with different formats, and there are effective ways
		available to treat multiple networks with routines that combine
		algebraic systems like the partially ordered semigroup or the
		semiring structure together with the relational bundles
		occurring in different types of multivariate network data sets.
		It also provides an algebraic approach for two-mode networks
		through Galois derivations between families of the pairs of
		subsets in the two domains.
