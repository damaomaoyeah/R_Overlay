		Collection of Common Astronomical Conversion Routines and
		Functions // Contains a number of common astronomy conversion
		routines, particularly the HMS and degrees schemes, which can
		be fiddly to convert between on mass due to the textural nature

		quickly. It also contains functions for various cosmological
