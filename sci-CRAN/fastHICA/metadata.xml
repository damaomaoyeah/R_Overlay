		Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis: a Multi-Scale Sparse
		Non-Orthogonal Data-Driven Basis // It implements HICA
		(Hierarchical Independent Component Analysis) algorithm. This
		approach, obtained through the integration between treelets and
		Independent Component Analysis, is able to provide a multi-
		scale non-orthogonal data-driven basis, whose elements have a
		phenomenological interpretation according to the problem under
		study.
