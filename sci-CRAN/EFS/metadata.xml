		Tool for Ensemble Feature Selection // Provides a function to
		check the importance of a feature based on a dependent
		classification variable. An ensemble of feature selection
		methods is used to determine the normalized importance value of
		all features. Combining these methods in one function (building
		the cumulative importance values) provides a stable feature
		selection tool. This selection can also be viewed in a barplot
		using the barplot_fs() function and proved using the evaluation
		function efs_eval().
