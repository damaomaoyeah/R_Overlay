		Tool for Ensemble Feature Selection // Provides a function to
		check the importance of a feature based on a dependent
		classification variable. An ensemble of correlation and
		importance measure tests are used to determine the normed
		importance value of all features. Combining these methods in
		one function (building the sum of the importance values) leads
		to a better tool for selecting most important features. This
		selection can also be viewed in a barplot using the
		barplot_fs() function and proved using an also provided
		function for a logistic regression model, namely logreg_test().
