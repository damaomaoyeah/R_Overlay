		Easy Data Manipulation, Data Quality and Statistical Checks //
		Offers useful functions to perform day-to-day data manipulation
		operations, data quality checks and post modelling statistical
		checks. One can effortlessly change class of a number of
		variables to factor, remove duplicate observations from the
		data, create deciles of a variable, perform data quality checks
		for continuous (integer or numeric), categorical (factor) and
		date variables, and compute goodness of fit measures such as
		auc for statistical models. The functions are consistent for
		objects of class 'data.frame' and 'data.table', which is an
		enhanced 'data.frame' implemented in the package 'data.table'.
