		An Individual-Based Population Genetic Simulation Environment //
		An interface between R and the 'metasim' simulation engine.
		Facilitates the use of the 'metasim' engine to build and run
		individual based population genetics simulations. The
		simulation environment is documented in: Allan Strand. Metasim
		1.0: an individual-based environment for simulating population
		genetics of complex population dynamics. Mol. Ecol. Notes,
		2:373-376, 2002. (Please contact Allan Strand with comments,
		bug reports, etc). This version represents a significant
		alteration of function names that hopefully increases
		consistency and reduces the chances of collisions with other
		packages naming conventions.  For a spatially-explicit, but
		slower, package with a similar interface, see 'kernelPop'.
