		Network Reconstruction and Changepoint Detection // Package
		EDISON (Estimation of Directed Interactions from Sequences Of
		Non-homogeneous gene expression) runs an MCMC simulation to
		reconstruct networks from time series data, using a non-
		homogeneous, time-varying dynamic Bayesian network. Networks
		segments and changepoints are inferred concurrently, and
		information sharing priors provide a reduction of the inference
		uncertainty.
