		The Lindley Distribution and Its Modifications // Implements the
		probability density function, quantile function, cumulative
		distribution function, random number generation and the hazard
		rate function for the continuous one-parameter Lindley
		distribution as well as for 15 of its modifications. Also is it
		possible to draw censored random samples, with a desired
		censoring rate, when the event times are any continuous
		lifetime distribution supported by R.
