		Download Files over HTTP and HTTPS // Provides a wrapper for the
		download.file function, making it possible to download files
		over HTTPS on Windows, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like platforms.
		The 'RCurl' package provides this functionality (and much more)
		but can be difficult to install because it must be compiled
		with external dependencies. This package has no external
		dependencies, so it is much easier to install.
