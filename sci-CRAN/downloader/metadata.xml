		A package for downloading files over http and https // This
		package provides a wrapper for the download.file function,
		making it possible to download files over https on Windows, Mac
		OS X, and other Unix-like platforms. The RCurl package provides
		this functionality (and much more) but can be difficult to
		install because it must be compiled with external dependencies.
		This package has no external dependencies, so it is much easier
		to install.
