		A Model-based Approach to Identify Binding Sites in CLIP-Seq Data
		// Cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with high-
		throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) has made it possible to
		identify targeting sites of RNA-binding proteins in various
		cell culture systems and tissue types on a genome-wide scale.
		Here we present MiClip,a novel model-based approach to identify
		high-confidence protein-RNA binding sites in CLIP-Seq datasets.
		This approach assigns confidence value to each binding site on
		a probabilistic basis. The MiClip package can be flexibly
		applied to analyze both HITS-CLIP data and PAR-CLIP data.
