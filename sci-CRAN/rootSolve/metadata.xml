		Nonlinear Root Finding, Equilibrium and Steady-State Analysis of
		Ordinary Differential Equations // Routines to find the root of
		nonlinear functions, and to perform steady-state and
		equilibrium analysis of ordinary differential equations (ODE).
		Includes routines that: (1) generate gradient and jacobian
		matrices (full and banded), (2) find roots of non-linear
		equations by the 'Newton-Raphson' method, (3) estimate steady-
		state conditions of a system of (differential) equations in
		full, banded or sparse form, using the 'Newton-Raphson' method,
		or by dynamically running, (4) solve the steady-state
		conditions for uni-and multicomponent 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D partial
		differential equations, that have been converted to ordinary
		differential equations by numerical differencing (using the
		method-of-lines approach). Includes fortran code.
