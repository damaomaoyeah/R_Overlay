		Evaluation of Classification Model Options // Designed to assist
		novice to intermediate analysts in choosing an optimal
		classification model, particularly for working with relatively
		small data sets. It provides cross-validated results comparing
		several different models at once using a consistent set of
		performance metrics, so users can hone in on the most promising
		approach rather than attempting single model fittings at a
		time. The package predefined 12 most common classification
		models, although users are free to select from the 200+ other
		options available in caret package.
