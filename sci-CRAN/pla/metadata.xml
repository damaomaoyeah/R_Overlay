		Parallel Line Assays // Parallel Line Assays: Completely
		randomized design, Randomized Block design, and Latin squares
		design. Balanced data are fitted as described in the Ph.Eur. In
		the presence of missing values complete data analysis can be
		performed (with computation of Fieller's confidence intervals
		for the estimated potency), or imputation of values can be
		applied. The package contains a script such that a pdf-document
		with a report of an analysis of an assay can be produced from
		an input file with data of the assay. Here no knowledge of R is
		needed by the user.
