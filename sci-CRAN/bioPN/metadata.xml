		Simulation of deterministic and stochastic biochemical reaction
		networks using Petri Nets // bioPN is a package suited to
		perform simulation of deterministic and stochastic systems of
		biochemical reaction networks. Models are defined using a
		subset of Petri Nets, in a way that is close at how chemical
		reactions are defined. For deterministic solutions, bioPN
		creates the associated system of differential equations "on the
		fly", and solves it with a Runge Kutta Dormand Prince 45
		explicit algorithm. For stochastic solutions, bioPN offers
		variants of Gillespie algorithm, or SSA. For hybrid
		deterministic/stochastic, it employs the Haseltine and Rawlings
		algorithm, that partitions the system in fast and slow
		reactions. bioPN algorithms are developed in C to achieve
		adequate performance.
