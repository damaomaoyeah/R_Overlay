		Data Exploration with Information Theory (Weight-of-Evidence and
		Information Value) // Performs exploratory data analysis and
		variable screening for binary classification models using
		weight-of-evidence (WOE) and information value (IV). In order
		to make the package as efficient as possible, aggregations are
		done in data.table and creation of WOE vectors can be
		distributed across multiple cores. The package also supports
		exploration for uplift models (NWOE and NIV).
