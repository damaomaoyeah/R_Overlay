		A Simple Graphical Representation of the Relative Occurrence and
		Co-Occurrence of Events // The unique function of this package
		allows representing in a single graph the relative occurrence
		and co-occurrence of events measured in a sample. As examples,
		the package was applied to describe the occurrence and co-
		occurrence of different species of bacterial or viral symbionts
		infecting arthropods at the individual level. The graphics
		allows determining the prevalence of each symbiont and the
		patterns of multiple infections (i.e. how different symbionts
		share or not the same individual hosts). We named the package
		after the famous painter as the graphical output recalls
		Mondrians paintings.
