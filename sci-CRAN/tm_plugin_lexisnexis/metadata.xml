		Import Articles from 'LexisNexis' Using the 'tm' Text Mining
		Framework // Provides a 'tm' Source to create corpora from
		articles exported from the 'LexisNexis' content provider as
		HTML files. It is able to read both text content and meta-data
		information (including source, date, title, author and pages).
		Note that the file format is highly unstable: there is no
		warranty that this package will work for your corpus, and you
		may have to adjust the code to adapt it to your particular
		format.
