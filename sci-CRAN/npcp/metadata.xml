		Some Nonparametric Tests for Change-Point Detection in Possibly
		Multivariate Observations // Provides nonparametric tests for
		assessing whether possibly serially dependent univariate or
		multivariate observations have the same c.d.f. or not. In
		addition to tests focusing directly on the c.d.f., the package
		contains tests designed to be particularly sensitive to changes
		in the underlying copula, Spearman's rho or certain quantities
		that can be estimated using one-sample U-statistics of order
		two such as the variance, Gini's mean difference or Kendall's
		tau. The latest addition is a nonparametric test for detecting
		changes in the distribution of independent block maxima.
