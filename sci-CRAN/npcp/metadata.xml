		Some nonparametric tests for change-point detection in
		(multivariate) observations // Provides nonparametric tests for
		assessing whether possibly serially dependent (multivariate)
		observations have the same c.d.f. or not. In addition to tests
		focusing directly on the (multivariate) c.d.f., the package
		contains tests designed to be particularly sensitive to changes
		in the underlying copula, Spearman's rho or certain quantities
		that can be estimated using one-sample U-statistics of order
		two such as the variance, Gini's mean difference or Kendall's
		tau.
