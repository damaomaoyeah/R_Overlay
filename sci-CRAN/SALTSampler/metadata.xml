		Efficient Sampling on the Simplex // The SALTSampler package
		facilitates Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling of random
		variables on a simplex. A Self-Adjusting Logit Transform (SALT)
		proposal is used so that sampling is still efficient even in
		difficult cases, such as those in high dimensions or with
		parameters that differ by orders of magnitude. Special care is
		also taken to maintain accuracy even when some coordinates
		approach 0 or 1 numerically. Diagnostic and graphic functions
		are included in the package, enabling easy assessment of the
		convergence and mixing of the chain within the constrained
		space.
