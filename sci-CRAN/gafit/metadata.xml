		Genetic Algorithm for Curve Fitting // A group of sample points
		are evaluated against a user-defined expression, the sample
		points are lists of parameters with values that may be
		substituted into that expression. The genetic algorithm
		attempts to make the result of the expression as low as
		possible (usually this would be the sum of residuals squared).
