		Nonparametric Methods for Identifying Differential Enrichment
		Regions with ChIP-Seq Data // Nonparametric Tests to identify
		the differential enrichment region for two conditions or time-
		course ChIP-seq data. It includes: data preprocessing function,
		estimation of a small constant used in hypothesis testing, a
		kernel-based two sample nonparametric test, two assumption-free
		two sample nonparametric test.
