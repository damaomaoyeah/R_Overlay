		Disparity Filter Algorithm for Weighted Networks // The disparity
		filter algorithm is a network reduction technique to identify
		the 'backbone' structure of a weighted network without
		destroying its multi-scale nature. The algorithm is documented
		in M. Angeles Serrano, Marian Boguna and Alessandro Vespignani
		in "Extracting the multiscale backbone of complex weighted
		networks", Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 106
		(16), 2009. This implementation of the algorithm supports both
		directed and undirected networks.
