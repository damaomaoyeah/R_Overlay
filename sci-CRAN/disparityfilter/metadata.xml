		Disparity Filter Algorithm of Weighted Network // Disparity
		filter is a network reduction algorithm to extract the backbone
		structure of both directed and undirected weighted networks.
		Disparity filter can reduce the network without destroying the
		multi-scale nature of the network. The algorithm has been
		developed by M. Angeles Serrano, Marian Boguna, and Alessandro
		Vespignani in Extracting the multiscale backbone of complex
		weighted networks, Proceedings of the national academy of
		sciences 106 (16).
