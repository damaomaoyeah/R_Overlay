		A Tool for Calculation and Optimization of the Expected Gain from
		Multi-Stage Selection // Multi-stage selection is practiced in
		numerous fields of life and social sciences and particularly in
		breeding. A special characteristic of multi-stage selection is
		that candidates are evaluated in successive stages with
		increasing intensity and effort, and only a fraction of the
		superior candidates is selected and promoted to the next stage.
		For the optimum design of such selection programs, the
		selection gain plays a crucial role. It can be calculated by
		integration of a truncated multivariate normal (MVN)
		distribution. While mathematical formulas for calculating the
		selection gain and the variance among selected candidates were
		developed long time ago, solutions for numerical calculation
		were not available. This package can also be used for
		optimizing multi-stage selection programs for a given total
		budget and different costs of evaluating the candidates in each
		stage.
