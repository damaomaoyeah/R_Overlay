		Bayesian Models for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in the Presence
		of Structural Zero Costs // Implements a full Bayesian cost-
		effectiveness analysis in the case where the cost variable is
		characterised by structural zeros. The package implements the
		Gamma, log-Normal and Normal models for the cost variable and
		the Gamma, Beta, Bernoulli and Normal models for the measure of
		clinical effectiveness.
