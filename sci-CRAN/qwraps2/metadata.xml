		Quick Wraps 2 // A collection of (wrapper) functions the creator
		found useful for quickly placing data summaries and formatted
		regression results into '.Rnw' or '.Rmd' files. Functions for
		generating commonly used graphics, such as receiver operating
		curves or Bland-Altman plots, are also provided by 'qwraps2'.
		'qwraps2' is a updated version of a package 'qwraps'. The
		original version 'qwraps' was never submitted to CRAN but can
		be found at https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps/. The
		implementation and limited scope of the functions within
		'qwraps2' https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps2/ is fundamentally
		different from 'qwraps'.
