		Joint Confidence Regions // Computing and plotting joint
		confidence regions and intervals. Regions include classical
		ellipsoids, minimum-volume or minimum-length regions, and an
		empirical Bayes region. Intervals include the TOST procedure
		with ordinary or expanded intervals and a fixed-sequence
		procedure. Such regions and intervals are useful e.g., for the
		assessment of multi-parameter (bio-)equivalence. Joint
		confidence regions for the mean and variance of a normal
		distribution are available as well.
