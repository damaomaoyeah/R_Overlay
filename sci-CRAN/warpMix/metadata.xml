		Mixed Effects Modeling with Warping for Functional Data Using
		B-Spline // Mixed effects modeling with warping for functional
		data using B- spline. Warping coefficients are considered as
		random effects, and warping functions are general functions,
		parameters representing the projection onto B- spline basis of
		a part of the warping functions. Warped data are modelled by a
		linear mixed effect functional model, the noise is Gaussian and
		independent from the warping functions.
