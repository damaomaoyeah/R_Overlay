		Analyzes Differential Promoter Composition in CAGE data //
		CAGExploreR implements an algorithm to calculate and evaluate
		the statistical significance of the uncertainty coefficient
		(a.k.a. Theil's U or the proportional entropy reduction). This
		statistic measures the strength of association between two
		nominal random variables. One specific application of this
		package is the detection of differential composition
		(differences in vectors of proportions) of genes subunits (e.g.
		promoters) across various biological conditions. The two
		nominal variables here are the biological conditions and the
		promoters within genes. The differential composition and the
		genomic location of these promoters can also be visualized
		using this package.
