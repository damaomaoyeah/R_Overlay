		Perform Exact Sign Test and Asymptotic Sign Test in Large Samples
		// Perform sign test on one-sample data, which is one of the
		oldest non-parametric statistical methods. Assume that X comes
		from a continuous distribution with median = v ( unknown ).
		Test the null hypothesis H0: median of X v = mu ( mu is the
		location parameter and is given in the test ) v.s. the
		alternative hypothesis H1: v  mu ( or v  mu or v != mu ) and
		calculate the p-value. When the sample size is large, perform
		the asymptotic sign test. In both ways, calculate the
		R-estimate of location of X and the distribution free
		confidence interval for mu.
