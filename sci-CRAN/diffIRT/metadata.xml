		Diffusion IRT Models for Response and Response Time Data //
		Package to fit diffusion-based IRT models to response and
		response time data. Models are fit using marginal maximum
		likelihood. Parameter restrictions (fixed value and equality
		constraints) are possible. In addition, factor scores (person
		drift rate and person boundary separation) can be estimated.
		Model fit assessment tools are also available. The traditional
		diffusion model can be estimated as well.
