		Utility functions for working with Random Number Generators //
		This package contains a set of functions for working with
		Random Number Generators (RNGs). In particular, it defines a
		generic S4 framework for getting/setting the current RNG, or
		RNG data that are embedded into objects for reproducibility.
		Notably, convenient default methods greatly facilitate the way
		current RNG settings can be changed.
