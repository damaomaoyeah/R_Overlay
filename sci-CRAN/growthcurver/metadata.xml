		Simple Metrics to Summarize Growth Curves // This is a simple
		package that fits the logistic equation to microbial growth
		curve data (e.g., repeated absorbance measurements taken from a
		plate reader over time). From this fit, a variety of metrics
		are provided, including the maximum growth rate, the doubling
		time, the carrying capacity, the area under the logistic curve,
		and the time to the inflection point.
