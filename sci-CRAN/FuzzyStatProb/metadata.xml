		Fuzzy Stationary Probabilities from a Sequence of Observations of
		an Unknown Markov Chain // An implementation of a method for
		computing fuzzy numbers representing stationary probabilities
		of an unknown Markov chain, from which a sequence of
		observations along time has been obtained. The algorithm is
		based on the proposal presented by James Buckley in his book on
		Fuzzy probabilities (Springer, 2005), chapter 6. Package
		FuzzyNumbers is used to represent the output probabilities.
