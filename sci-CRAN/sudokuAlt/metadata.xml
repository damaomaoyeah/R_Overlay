		Tools for Making and Spoiling Sudoku Games // Tools for making,
		retrieving, displaying and solving sudoku games. This package
		is an alternative to the earlier sudoku-solver package,
		'sudoku'.  The present package uses a slightly different
		algorithm, has a simpler coding and presents a few more sugar
		tools, such as plot and print methods.  Solved sudoku games are
		of some interest in Experimental Design as examples of Latin
		Square designs with additional balance constraints.
