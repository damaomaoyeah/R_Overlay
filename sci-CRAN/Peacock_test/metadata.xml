		Two and Three Dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov Two-Sample Tests //
		The original definition of the two and three dimensional
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test statistics given by Peacock
		(1983) is implemented. Two R-functions: peacock2 and peacock3,
		are provided to compute the test statistics in two and three
		dimensional spaces, respectively. Note the Peacock test is
		different from the Fasano and Franceschini test (1987). The
		latter is a variant of the Peacock test.
