		Generation of Bivariate Uniform Data and Its Relation to
		Bivariate Binary Data // Simulation of bivariate uniform data
		with a full range of correlations based on two beta densities
		and computation of the tetrachoric correlation (correlation of
		bivariate uniform data) from the phi coefficient (correlation
		of bivariate binary data) and vice versa.
