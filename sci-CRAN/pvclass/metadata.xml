		P-Values for Classification // Computes nonparametric p-values
		for the potential class memberships of new observations as well
		as cross-validated p-values for the training data. The p-values
		are based on permutation tests applied to an estimated Bayesian
		likelihood ratio, using a plug-in statistic for the Gaussian
		model, 'k nearest neighbors', 'weighted nearest neighbors' or
		'penalized logistic regression'. Additionally, it provides
		graphical displays and quantitative analyses of the p-values.
