		Tools for Grid-Based Survey Sampling Design // Multi-stage
		cluster household surveys are commonly performed by governments
		and programs to monitor population demographic, social,
		economic, and health outcomes. In these surveys, communities
		are sampled in a first  stage of sampling from within
		subpopulations of interest (or strata), households are sampled
		in a second stage of sampling, and sometimes individuals are
		listed and further sampled within households. The first stage
		of sampling, where communities of sample populations are
		defined, are called Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) while the
		households are secondary sampling units (SSUs). Census data are
		typically used to select PSUs within strata. If census data are
		outdated, inaccurate, or not available at fine enough scale,
		however, gridded population data can be used instead. This tool
		selects PSUs within user-defined strata using gridded
		population data, given desired numbers of sampled households
		within each PSU. The population densities used to create PSUs
		are drawn from rasters such as the population data from the
		WorldPop Project (http://www.worldpop.org.uk). PSUs are defined
		within a stratum using a serpentine sampling method, and can be
		set to have a certain ratio of urban and rural PSUs, or to be
		evenly distributed across a coarse, user-defined grid.
