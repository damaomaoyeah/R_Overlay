		SHrinkage covariance Incorporating Prior knowledge // The SHIP-
		package allows the estimation of various types of shrinkage
		covariance matrices. These types differ in terms of the so-
		called covariance target (to be chosen by the user), the highly
		structured matrix which the standard unbiased sample covariance
		matrix is shrunken towards and which optionally incorporates
		prior biological knowledge extracted from the database KEGG.
		The shrinkage intensity is obtained via an analytical
		procedure.
