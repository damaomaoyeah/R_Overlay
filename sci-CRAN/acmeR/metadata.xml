		Implements ACME Estimator of Bird and Bat Mortality by Wind
		Turbines // Implementation of estimator ACME, described in
		Wolpert (2015), ACME: A Partially Periodic Estimator of Avian
		Chiropteran Mortality at Wind Turbines (submitted).  Unlike
		most other models, this estimator supports decreasing-hazard
		Weibull model for persistence; decreasing search proficiency as
		carcasses age; variable bleed-through at successive searches;
		and interval mortality estimates.  The package provides, based
		on search data, functions for estimating the mortality
		inflation factor in Frequentist and Bayesian settings.
