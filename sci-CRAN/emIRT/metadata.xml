		EM Algorithms for Estimating Item Response Theory Models //
		Various Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithms are
		implemented for item response theory (IRT) models. The current
		implementation includes IRT models for binary and ordinal
		responses, along with dynamic and hierarchical IRT models with
		binary responses. The latter two models are derived and
		implemented using variational EM.
