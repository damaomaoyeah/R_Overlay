		Threads Environment for R // Provides a threads-type programming
		environment for R. The package gives the R programmer the
		clearer, more concise shared memory world view, and in some
		cases gives superior performance as well.  In addition, it
		enables parallel processing on very large, out-of-core
		matrices.
