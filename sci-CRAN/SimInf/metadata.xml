		A Framework for Data-Driven Stochastic Disease Spread Simulations
		// Livestock movements are important for the spread of many
		infectious diseases between herds. The package provides an
		efficient and flexible framework for stochastic disease spread
		modelling that integrates within-herd disease dynamics as
		continuous-time Markov chains and livestock movements between
		herds as scheduled events. The core simulation solver is
		implemented in C and uses 'OpenMP' (if available) to divide
		work over multiple processors. The package contains template
		models and can be extended with user defined models.
