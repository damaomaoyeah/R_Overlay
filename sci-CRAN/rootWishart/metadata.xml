		Distribution of Largest Root for Single and Double Wishart
		Settings // Functions for hypothesis testing in single and
		double Wishart settings, based on Roy's largest root. This test
		statistic is especially useful in multivariate analysis. The
		computations are based on results by Chiani (2014)
		DOI:10.1016/j.jmva.2014.04.002 and Chiani (2016)
		DOI:10.1016/j.jmva.2015.10.007. They use the fact that the CDF
		is related to the Pfaffian of a matrix that can be computed in
		a finite number of iterations. This package takes advantage of
		the Boost and Eigen C++ libraries to perform multi-precision
		linear algebra.
