		Allele simulation and Haplotype reconstruction from pedigree
		databases // This package contains tools for simulating
		alphanumeric alleles from parent-offspring pedigree databases
		to later reconstruct the corresponding non-recombinant
		haplotypes. Allelic simulations can be implemented taking into
		account many different factors (such as number of families,
		markers, alleles per marker, probability of missing genotypes,
		recombination rate, etc). Haplotype reconstruction can be
		performed even with missing data.
