		Allele Imputation and Haplotype Reconstruction from Pedigree
		Databases // Simulation of alphanumeric alleles, imputation of
		genetic missing data and reconstruction of non-recombinant
		haplotypes from pedigree databases in a deterministic way.
		Allelic simulations can be implemented taking into account many
		different factors (such as number of families, markers, alleles
		per marker, probability and proportion of missing genotypes,
		recombination rate, etc). Genotype imputation can be used
		either simulated datasets or loaded databases (in .ped file
		biallelic format). Haplotype reconstruction can be performed
		even with missing data because of alleHap, firstly imputes the
		genotypes. All this considering that each member (due to
		meiosis) should unequivocally have two alleles, one inherited
		from each parent.
