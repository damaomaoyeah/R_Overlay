		Multi-Resolution Estimation of the Hazard Rate // Used on
		survival data to jointly estimate the hazard rate and the
		effects of covariates on failure times. Can accommodate
		covariates under the proportional and non-proportional hazards
		setting, and is ideal for analysis of survival data with long-
		term follow-up.
