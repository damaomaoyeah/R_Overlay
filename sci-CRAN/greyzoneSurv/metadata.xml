		Fit a Grey-Zone Model with Survival Data // Allows one to
		classify patients into low, intermediate, and high risk groups
		for disease progression based on a continuous marker that is
		associated with progression-free survival. It uses a latent
		class model to link the marker and survival outcome and
		produces two cutoffs for the marker to divide patients into
		three groups. See the References section for more details.
