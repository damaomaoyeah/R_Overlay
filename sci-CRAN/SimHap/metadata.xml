		A comprehensive modeling framework for epidemiological outcomes
		and a simulation-based approach to haplotypic analysis of
		population-based data // SimHap is a package for genetic
		association testing. It can perform single SNP and multi-locus
		(haplotype) association analyses for continuous Normal, binary,
		longitudinal and right-censored outcomes measured in
		population-based samples. SimHap uses estimation maximisation
		techniques for inferring haplotypic phase in individuals, and
		incorporates a novel simulation-based approach to deal with the
		uncertainty of imputed haplotypes in association testing.
