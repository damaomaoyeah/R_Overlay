		Tolerance Intervals and Errors-in-Variables Regressions in Method
		Comparison Studies // Assess the agreement in method comparison
		studies by tolerance intervals and errors-in-variables
		regressions. The Ordinary Least Square regressions (OLSv and
		OLSh), the Deming Regression (DR), and the
		(Correlated)-Bivariate Least Square regressions (BLS and CBLS)
		can be used with unreplicated or replicated data. The BLS and
		CBLS are the two main functions to estimate a regression line,
		while XY.plot and MD.plot are the two main graphical functions
		to display, respectively an (X,Y) plot or (M,D) plot with the
		BLS or CBLS results. Assuming no proportional bias, the (M,D)
		plot (Band-Altman plot) may be simplified by calculating
		horizontal lines intervals with tolerance intervals (beta-
		expectation (type I) or beta-gamma content (type II)).
