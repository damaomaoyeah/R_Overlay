		A Tool Box for Multivariate Meta-Analysis // A comprehensive
		collection of functions for multivariate meta-analysis. This
		package includes functions that implement methods to estimate
		the pooled effect sizes and the components of the between-study
		covariance matrix for multivariate meta-analysis with
		continuous outcomes or binary outcomes. This package also
		provides functions for detecting publication bias when the
		within-study correlations are unknown.
