		Permutation of Species During Turnover Events // Provides a
		robust framework for analyzing the extent to which differential
		survival with respect to higher level trait variation is
		reducible to lower level variation. In addition to its primary
		test, it also provides functions for simulation-based power
		analysis, reading in common data set formats, and visualizing
		results. Temporarily contains an edited version of function
		hr.mcp() from package 'wild1', written by Glen Sargeant.
