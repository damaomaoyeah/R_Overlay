		Sequential BART for Imputation of Missing Covariates //
		Implements the sequential BART (Bayesian Additive Regression
		Trees) approach to impute the missing covariates. The algorithm
		applies a Bayesian nonparametric approach on factored sets of
		sequential conditionals of the joint distribution of the
		covariates and the missingness and applying the Bayesian
		additive regression trees to model each of these univariate
		conditionals. Each conditional distribution is then sampled
		using MCMC algorithm. The published journal can be found at
		https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxw009 Package provides a
		function, seqBART(), which computes and returns the imputed
		values.
