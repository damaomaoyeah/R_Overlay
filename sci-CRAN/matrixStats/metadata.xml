		Functions that Apply to Rows and Columns of Matrices (and to
		Vectors) // High-performing functions operating on rows and
		columns of matrices, e.g. col / rowMedians(), col / rowRanks(),
		and col / rowSds().  Functions optimized per data type and for
		subsetted calculations such that both memory usage and
		processing time is minimized.  There are also optimized vector-
		based methods, e.g. binMeans(), madDiff() and
		weightedMedians().
