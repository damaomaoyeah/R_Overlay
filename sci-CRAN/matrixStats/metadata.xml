		Methods that Apply to Rows and Columns of Matrices (and to
		Vectors) // Methods operating on rows and columns of matrices,
		e.g. col / rowMedians(), col / rowRanks(), and col / rowSds().
		There are also some vector-based methods, e.g. binMeans(),
		madDiff() and weightedMedians().  All methods have been
		optimized for speed and memory usage.
