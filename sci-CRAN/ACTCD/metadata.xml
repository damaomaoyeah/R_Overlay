		Asymptotic Classification Theory for Cognitive Diagnosis // This
		package includes functions used to perform cluster analysis for
		cognitive diagnosis based on the Asymptotic Classification
		Theory (Chiu, Douglas  Li, 2009). Given the sample statistic of
		sum-scores and the item-by-attribute association matrix
		(Q-matrix; Tatsuoka, 1985), cluster analysis techniques can be
		used to classify examinees into latent classes based on their
		attribute patterns. In addition to the algorithms used to
		classify data, three labeling approaches are proposed to label
		clusters so that examinees' attribute profiles can be obtained.
