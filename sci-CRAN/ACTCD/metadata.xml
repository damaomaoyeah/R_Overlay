		Asymptotic Classification Theory for Cognitive Diagnosis //
		Cluster analysis for cognitive diagnosis based on the
		Asymptotic Classification Theory (Chiu, Douglas  Li, 2009;
		doi:10.1007/s11336-009-9125-0). Given the sample statistic of
		sum-scores, cluster analysis techniques can be used to classify
		examinees into latent classes based on their attribute
		patterns. In addition to the algorithms used to classify data,
		three labeling approaches are proposed to label clusters so
		that examinees' attribute profiles can be obtained.
