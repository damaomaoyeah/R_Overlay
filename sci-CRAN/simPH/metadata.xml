		Tools for simulating and plotting quantities of interest
		estimated from Cox Proportional Hazards models // The package
		simulates and plots quantities of interest (relative hazards,
		first differences, and hazard ratios) for linear coefficients,
		multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines,
		and non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survival
		curves from Cox Proportional Hazard models. It also simulates
		and plots marginal effects for multiplicative interactions.
