		Tools for Simulating and Plotting Quantities of Interest
		Estimated from Cox Proportional Hazards Models // Simulates and
		plots quantities of interest (relative hazards, first
		differences, and hazard ratios) for linear coefficients,
		multiplicative interactions, polynomials, penalised splines,
		and non-proportional hazards, as well as stratified survival
		curves from Cox Proportional Hazard models. It also simulates
		and plots marginal effects for multiplicative interactions.
