		Choice of the Hyperparameter Omega in the Bayesian Adjustment for
		Confounding (BAC) Algorithm // The BACprior package provides an
		approximate sensitivity analysis of the Bayesian Adjustment for
		Confounding (BAC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2012) with regards to
		the hyperparameter omega. The package also provides functions
		to guide the user in their choice of an appropriate omega
		value. The method is based on Lefebvre, Atherton and Talbot
		(2014).
