		Regression Estimation Based on the Compound Covariate Method
		Under the Cox Proportional Hazard Model // Calculate regression
		coefficients and their standard deviations under the Cox
		proportional hazard model with a large number of covariates. A
		shrinkage type estimation based on the compound covariate
		method (Emura, Chen  Chen, 2012 PLoS ONE) and a univariate gene
		selection method under dependent censoring (Emura  Chen, 2014
		Statistical Methods in Medical Research) are implemented.
		Algorithms for simulating gene expressions in these references
		are also given.
