		Data Manipulation Extensions of 'Dplyr' and 'Tidyr' // If 'dplyr'
		is a grammar for data manipulation, 'extdplyr' is like a short
		paragraph written in 'dplyr'. 'extdplyr' extends 'dplyr' and
		'tidyr' verbs to some common "routines" that manipulate data
		sets. It uses the same interface and preserves all the features
		from 'dplyr', has good performance, and supports various data
		sources.
