		Johnson Transformation for Normality // Transforming univariate
		non-normal data to normality using Johnson families of
		distributions. Johnson family is a comprehensive distribution
		family that accommodates many kinds of non-normal
		distributions. A bunch of distributions with various parameters
		will be fit and the corresponding p-values under a user-
		specified normality test will be given. The final
		transformation will be the one with the largest p-value under
		the given normality test.
