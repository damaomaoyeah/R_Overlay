		Causal Inference Test // A formal statistical hypothesis test,
		resulting in a p-value, is provided to quantify uncertainty in
		a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e.g. a
		molecular species, which potentially mediates a known causal
		association between a locus and a quantitative trait. The test
		is applicable to data that includes genotype (discrete),
		possible causal mediator such as gene expression (continuous)
		and an outcome of interest (continuous).
