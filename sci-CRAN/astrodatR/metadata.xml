		Astronomical Data // A collection of 19 datasets from
		contemporary astronomical research.  They are described the
		textbook `Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy with R
		Applications' by Eric D. Feigelson and G. Jogesh Babu
		(Cambridge University Press, 2012, Appendix C) or on the
		website of Penn State's Center for Astrostatistics
		(http://astrostatistics.psu.edu/datasets).  These datasets can
		be used to exercise methodology involving: density estimation;
		heteroscedastic measurement errors; contingency tables; two-
		sample hypothesis tests; spatial point processes; nonlinear
		regression; mixture models; censoring and truncation;
		multivariate analysis; classification and clustering;
		inhomogeneous Poisson processes; periodic and stochastic time
		series analysis.
