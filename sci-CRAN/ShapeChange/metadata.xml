		Change-Point Estimation using Shape-Restricted Splines // In a
		scatterplot where the response variable is Gaussian, Poisson or
		binomial, we consider the case in which the mean function is
		smooth with a change-point, which is a mode, an inflection
		point or a jump point. The main routine estimates the mean
		curve and the change-point as well using shape-restricted
		B-splines. An optional subroutine delivering a bootstrapping
		confidence interval for the change-point is incorporated in the
		main routine.
