		Interactive Interpretation of Linear Regression Models //
		Interactive visualization of effects, response functions and
		marginal effects for different kinds of regression models. In
		this version linear regression models, generalized linear
		models, generalized additive models and linear mixed-effects
		models are supported. Major features are the interactive
		approach and the handling of the effects of categorical
		covariates: if two or more factors are used as covariates every
		combination of the levels of each factor is treated separately.
		The automatic calculation of marginal effects and a number of
		possibilities to customize the graphical output are useful
		features as well.
