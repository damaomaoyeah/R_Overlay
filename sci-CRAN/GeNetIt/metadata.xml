		Spatial Graph-Theoretic Genetic Gravity Modelling //
		Implementation of spatial graph-theoretic genetic gravity
		models. The model framework is applicable for other types of
		spatial flow questions. Includes functions for constructing
		spatial graphs, sampling and summarizing associated raster
		variables and building unconstrained and singly constrained
		gravity models.
