		Truth Table Logic Optimizer // Access to powerful logic
		minimization algorithms and data structures that operate on a
		sum-of-products truth table.  The core algorithms are built on
		Espresso Version 2.3 developed at UC Berkeley for digital logic
		synthesis purposes.  Enhancements have been made to integrate
		within the R framework and support additional logic
		optimization use cases such as those needed by Qualitative
		Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Genetic Programming.  There are
		no expressed or implied warranties.
