		General-Purpose MCMC and SMC Samplers and Tools for Bayesian
		Statistics // General-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as
		plot and diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics, with a
		particular focus on calibrating complex system models.
		Implemented samplers include various Metropolis MCMC variants
		(including adaptive and/or delayed rejection MH), the T-walk,
		two differential evolution MCMCs, two DREAM MCMCs, and a
		sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filter.
