		Epistatic and penetrance models for two-locus genetic
		interactions // The 'epipen' package provides a set of
		utilities for using common models of epistasis. Interactions
		between two biallelic loci (e.g. SNPs) can easily be
		represented using GLM regression parameters, penetrance models,
		or variance components. Functions are included for conversion
		among these common interaction models, as well as data
		generation, power analysis, and effect size measures.
