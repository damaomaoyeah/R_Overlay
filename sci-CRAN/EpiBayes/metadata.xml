		Implements Hierarchical Bayesian Models for Epidemiological
		Applications // Hierarchical Bayesian models for use in disease
		freedom and disease prevalence studies, designed with
		epidemiological applications in mind. The models themselves are
		in the spirit of those presented in Branscum et al. (2006) (see
		package documentation for full reference). The helper functions
		and methods were designed to make implementation and processing
		of the complex model output relatively simple in application.
