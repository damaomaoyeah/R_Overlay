		Tests for Type I Error in Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)
		// Implements tests for Type I error in Qualitative Comparative
		Analysis (QCA) that take into account the multiple hypothesis
		tests inherent in the procedure. Tests can be carried out on
		three variants of QCA: crisp-set QCA (csQCA), multi-value QCA
		(mvQCA) and fuzzy-set QCA (fsQCA). For fsQCA, the
		fsQCApermTest() command implements a permutation test that
		provides 95% confidence intervals for the number of
		counterexamples and degree of consistency, respectively. The
		distributions of permuted values can be plotted against the
		observed values. For csQCA and mvQCA, simple binomial tests are
		implemented in csQCAbinTest() and mvQCAbinTest(), respectively.
