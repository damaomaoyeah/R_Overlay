		Builds and analyses Integral Projection Models (IPMs). // IPMpack
		takes demographic vital rates and (optionally) environmental
		data to build integral projection models.  A number of
		functional forms for growth and survival can be incorporated,
		as well as a range of reproductive strategies.  The package
		also includes a suite of diagnostic routines, provides classic
		matrix model output (e.g., lambda, elasticities,
		sensitivities), and produces post-hoc metrics (e.g., passage
		time and life expectancy).
