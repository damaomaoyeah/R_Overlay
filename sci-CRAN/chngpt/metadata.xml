		Change Point Logistic Regression // Hypothesis testing in change
		point logistic regression with or without interaction terms.
		Several options are provided for testing in models with
		interaction, including a maximum of likelihood ratios test that
		determines p-value through Monte Carlo. Estimation under change
		point model is also included, but less developed at this point.
