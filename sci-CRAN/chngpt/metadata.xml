		Change Point Regression // Change point regression models are
		also called two-phase regression, break-point regression,
		split-point regression, structural change models and threshold
		regression models. Hypothesis testing in change point logistic
		regression with or without interaction terms. Several options
		are provided for testing in models with interaction, including
		a maximum of likelihood ratios test that determines p-value
		through Monte Carlo. Estimation under change point model is
		also included, but less developed at this point.
