		like base::sets tools but keeps duplicate elements. // The base
		'sets' tools follow the algebraic definition that each element
		of a set must be unique. Since it's often helpful to compare
		all elements of two vectors, this toolset treats every element
		as unique for counting purposes. For ease of use, all functions
		in vecsets have an argument 'multiple' which, when set to
		FALSE, reverts them to the base::set tools functionality.
