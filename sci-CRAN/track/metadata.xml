		Store Objects on Disk Automatically // Automatically stores
		objects in files on disk so that files are rewritten when
		objects are changed, and so that objects are accessible but do
		not occupy memory until they are accessed. Keeps track of times
		when objects are created and modified, and caches some basic
		characteristics of objects to allow for fast summaries of
		objects.  Also provides a command history mechanism that saves
		the last command to a history file after each command
		completes.
