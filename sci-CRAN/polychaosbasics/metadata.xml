		Sensitivity Indexes Calculated from Polynomial Chaos Expansions
		// Computation of sensitivity indexes by using a method based
		on a truncated Polynomial Chaos Expansions of the response. The
		necessary condition of the method is: the inputs must be
		uniformly and independently sampled. Since the inputs are
		uniformly distributed, the truncated Polynomial Chaos Expansion
		is built from the multivariate Legendre orthogonal polynomials.
