		Null Model Analysis for Ecological Data // Given a site by
		species interaction matrix, users can make inferences about
		species interactions by performance hypothesis comparing test
		statistics against a null distribution. The current package
		provides algorithms and metrics for niche-overlap, body size
		ratios and species co-occurrence. Users can also integrate
		their own algorithms and metrics within these frameworks or
		completely novel null models. Detailed explanations about the
		underlying assumptions of null model analysis in ecology can be
		found at http://ecosimr.org.
