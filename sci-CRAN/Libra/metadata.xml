		Linearized Bregman Algorithms for Generalized Linear Models //
		Efficient procedures for fitting the regularization path for
		linear, binomial, multinomial, Ising and Potts models with
		lasso, group lasso or column lasso(only for multinomial)
		penalty. The package uses Linearized Bregman Algorithm to solve
		the regularization path through iterations. Bregman Inverse
		Scale Space Differential Inclusion solver is also provided for
		linear model with lasso penalty.
