		Maximin-Distance (Sliced) Latin Hypercube Designs // Generate the
		optimal Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) for computer experiments
		with quantitative factors and the optimal Sliced Latin
		Hypercube Designs (SLHDs) for computer experiments with both
		quantitative and qualitative factors. Details of the algorithm
		can be found in Ba, S., Brenneman, W. A. and Myers, W. R.
		(2015), "Optimal Sliced Latin Hypercube Designs,"
		Technometrics. Important function in this package is
		"maximinSLHD".
