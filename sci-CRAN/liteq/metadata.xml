		Lightweight Portable Message Queue Using 'SQLite' // Temporary
		and permanent message queues for R. Built on top of 'SQLite'
		databases. 'SQLite' provides locking, and makes it possible to
		detect crashed consumers. Crashed jobs can be automatically
		marked as "failed", or put in the queue again, potentially a
		limited number of times.
