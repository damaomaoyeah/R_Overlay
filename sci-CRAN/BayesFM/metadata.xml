		Bayesian Inference for Factor Modeling // Collection of
		procedures to perform Bayesian analysis on a variety of factor
		models. Currently, it includes: Bayesian Exploratory Factor
		Analysis (befa), an approach to dedicated factor analysis with
		stochastic search on the structure of the factor loading
		matrix. The number of latent factors, as well as the allocation
		of the manifest variables to the factors, are not fixed a
		priori but determined during MCMC sampling. More approaches
		will be included in future releases of this package.
