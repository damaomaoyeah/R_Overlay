		A data smoothing approach to explore and test gene-environment
		interaction in case-parent trio data // The package contains
		functions that 1) estimates gene-environment interaction
		between a SNP and a continuous non-genetic attribute by fitting
		a generalized additive model to case-parent trio data, 2)
		produces graphical displays of estimated interaction, 3)
		performs permutation test of gene-environment interaction; 4)
		simulates informative case-parent trios.
