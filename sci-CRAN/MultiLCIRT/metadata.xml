		Multidimensional Latent Class Item Response Theory Models //
		Framework for the Item Response Theory analysis of dichotomous
		and ordinal polytomous outcomes under the assumption of
		multidimensionality and discreteness of the latent traits. The
		fitting algorithms allow for missing responses and for
		different item parameterizations and are based on the
		Expectation-Maximization paradigm. Individual covariates
		affecting the class weights may be included in the new version
		(since 2.1).
