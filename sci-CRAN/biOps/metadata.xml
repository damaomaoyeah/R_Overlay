		Image processing and analysis // This package includes several
		methods for image processing and analysis. It provides
		geometric, arithmetic, logic, morphologic (supported on one
		channel images only), look-up tables, edge detection (including
		Roberts, Sobel, Kirsch, Marr-Hildreth and Canny, among others)
		and convolution masks operations (predefined commons masks
		already defined and user defined applications). Isodata and
		k-means classification methods are also provided (standard, kd-
		tree and brute force methods implemented). Fast Fourier
		Transform methods and filters also available if fftw3
		installed. Supports jpeg and tiff images so far (more image
		support in future versions). libtiff and libjpeg libraries
		installed required.
