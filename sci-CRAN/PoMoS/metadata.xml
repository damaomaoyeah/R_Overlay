		Polynomial (ordinary differential equation) Model Search //
		PoMoS-package aims to determine from a set of N time series the
		optimal polynomial structure of a model built on first-order
		ordinary differential equations. The core of the package is
		based on the poMoS function: an evolutionary algorithm combined
		with a least square fitting. Optimality is estimated with AIC
		(Akaike, 1974) or AIC-like criterions. Although efficient in
		its selection, the identification of the optimal structure
		cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, both selected and rejected
		models are reconsidered after optimal solutions are obtained
		from the evolutionary algorithm for another analysis. This
		analysis is based on a statistical evaluation of the
		regressors' quality.
