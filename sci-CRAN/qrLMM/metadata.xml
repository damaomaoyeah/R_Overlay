		Quantile Regression for Linear Mixed-Effects Models // Quantile
		regression (QR) for Linear Mixed-Effects Models via the
		asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD). It uses the Stochastic
		Approximation of the EM (SAEM) algorithm for deriving exact
		maximum likelihood estimates and full inference results for the
		fixed-effects and variance components. It also provides
		graphical summaries for assessing the algorithm convergence and
		fitting results.
