		Calculate Design Parameters for Biomarker Validation Studies //
		Helps a clinical trial team  discuss the clinical goals  of a
		well-defined biomarker with a diagnostic, staging, prognostic,
		or predictive purpose.  From this discussion will come a
		statistical plan for a (non-randomized) validation trial. Both
		prospective and retrospective trials are supported. In a
		specific focused discussion, investigators should determine the
		range of "discomfort" for the NNT, number needed to treat.  The
		meaning of the discomfort range, [NNTlower, NNTupper], is that
		within this range most physicians would feel discomfort either
		in treating or withholding treatment. A pair of NNT values
		bracketing that range, NNTpos and NNTneg, become the targets of
		the study's design.  If the trial can demonstrate that a
		positive biomarker test yields an NNT less than NNTlower, and
		that a negative biomarker test yields an NNT less than
		NNTlower, then the biomarker may be useful for patients. A
		highlight of the package is visualization of a "contra-Bayes"
		theorem, which produces criteria for retrospective case-
		controls studies.
