		Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments // Generalized Method of
		Wavelet Moments (GMWM) is an estimation technique for the
		parameters of time series models. It uses the wavelet variance
		in a moment matching approach that makes it particularly
		suitable for the estimation of certain state-space models.
		Furthermore, there exists a robust implementation of GMWM,
		which allows the robust estimation of some state-space models
		and ARIMA models. Lastly, the package provides the ability to
		quickly generate time series data, perform different wavelet
		decompositions, and visualizations.
