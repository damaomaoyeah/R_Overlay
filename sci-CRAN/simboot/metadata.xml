		Simultaneous inference for diversity indices. // Package simboot
		provides estimation of simultaneous bootstrap and asymptotic
		confidence intervals for diversity indices, namely the Shannon
		and the Simpson index. Several pre--specified multiple
		comparison types are available to choose. Further user--defined
		contrast matrices are applicable. In addition, simboot
		estimates adjusted as well as unadjusted p--values for two of
		the three proposed bootstrap methods. Further simboot allows
		for comparing biological diversities of two or more groups
		while simultaneously testing a user-defined selection of Hill
		numbers of orders q, which are considered as appropriate and
		useful indices for measuring diversity.
