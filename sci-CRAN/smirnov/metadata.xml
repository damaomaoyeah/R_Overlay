		Provides two taxonomic coefficients from E. S. Smirnov "Taxonomic
		analysis" (1969) book // This tiny package contains one
		function smirnov() which calculates two scaled taxonomic
		coefficients, Txy (coefficient of similarity) and Txx
		(coefficient of originality). These two characteristics may be
		used for the analysis of similarities between any number of
		taxonomic groups, and also for assessing uniqueness of giving
		taxon. It is possible to use smirnov() output as a distance
		measure: convert it to distance by "as.dist(1 - smirnov(x))".
