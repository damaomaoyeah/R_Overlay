		Animated Normal Quantile-Quantile Plots // Presents an
		explanatory animation of normal quantile-quantile plots based
		on a water-filling analogy.  The animation presents a normal QQ
		plot as the parametric plot of the water levels in vases
		defined by two distributions.  The distributions decorate the
		axes in the normal QQ plot and are optionally shown as vases
		adjacent to the plot.  The package draws QQ plots for several
		distributions, either as samples or continuous functions.
