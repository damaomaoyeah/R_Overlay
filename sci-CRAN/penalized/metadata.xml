		L1 (lasso and fused lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalized estimation in
		GLMs and in the Cox model // A package for fitting possibly
		high dimensional penalized regression models. The penalty
		structure can be any combination of an L1 penalty (lasso and
		fused lasso), an L2 penalty (ridge) and a positivity constraint
		on the regression coefficients. The supported regression models
		are linear, logistic and Poisson regression and the Cox
		Proportional Hazards model. Cross-validation routines allow
		optimization of the tuning parameters.
