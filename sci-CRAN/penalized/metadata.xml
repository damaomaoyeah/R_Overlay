		L1 (Lasso and Fused Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) Penalized Estimation in
		GLMs and in the Cox Model // Fitting possibly high dimensional
		penalized regression models. The penalty structure can be any
		combination of an L1 penalty (lasso and fused lasso), an L2
		penalty (ridge) and a positivity constraint on the regression
		coefficients. The supported regression models are linear,
		logistic and Poisson regression and the Cox Proportional
		Hazards model. Cross-validation routines allow optimization of
		the tuning parameters.
