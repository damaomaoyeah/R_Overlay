		Robust Estimation for Generalized Additive Models // This package
		provides robust estimation for generalized additive models. It
		implements a fast and stable algorithm in Wong, Yao and Lee
		(2013). The implementation also contains three automatic
		selection methods for smoothing parameter. They are designed to
		be robust to outliers. For more details, see Wong, Yao and Lee
		(2013).
