		Power Calculations for GxE and GxG Interactions for GWAS //
		Analytical power calculations for GxE and GxG interactions for
		case-control studies of candidate genes and genome-wide
		association studies (GWAS). This includes power calculation for
		four two-step screening and testing procedures.  It can also
		calculate power for GxE and GxG without any screening.
