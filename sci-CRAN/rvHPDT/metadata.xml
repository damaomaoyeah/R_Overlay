		Calling haplotype-based and variant-based pedigree disequilibrium
		test for rare variants in pedigrees. // To detecting rare
		variants for binary traits using general pedigrees, the
		pedigree disequilibrium tests are proposed by collapsing rare
		haplotypes/variants with/without weights. To run the test,
		MERLIN is needed in Linux for haplotyping.
