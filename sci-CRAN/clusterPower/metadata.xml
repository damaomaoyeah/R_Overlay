		Power calculations for cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized
		crossover trials // This package enables researchers to
		calculate power for cluster-randomized crossover trials by
		employing a simulation-based approach.  A particular study
		design is specified, with fixed sample sizes for all clusters
		and an assumed treatment effect, and the empirical power for
		that study design is calculated by simulating hypothetical
		datasets.
