		Bayesian Inference for Differential Equations // A Bayesian
		framework for parameter inference in differential equations.
		This approach offers a rigorous methodology for parameter
		inference as well as modeling the link between unobservable
		model states and parameters, and observable quantities.
		Provides templates for the DE model, the observation model and
		data likelihood, and the model parameters and their prior
		distributions. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure
		processes these inputs to estimate the posterior distributions
		of the parameters and any derived quantities, including the
		model trajectories. Further functionality is provided to
		facilitate MCMC diagnostics and the visualisation of the
		posterior distributions of model parameters and trajectories.
