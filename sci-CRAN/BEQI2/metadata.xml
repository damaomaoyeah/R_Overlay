		Benthic Ecosystem Quality Index 2 // Tool for analysing benthos
		data. It estimates several quality indices like the total
		abundance of species, species richness, Margalef's d, AZTI
		Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), and the BEQI-2 index. Furthermore,
		additional (optional) features are provided that enhance data
		preprocessing: (1) genus to species conversion, i.e.,taxa
		counts at the taxonomic genus level can optionally be converted
		to the species level and (2) pooling: small samples are
		combined to bigger samples with a standardized size to (a) meet
		the data requirements of the AMBI, (b) generate comparable
		species richness values and (c) give a higher benthos signal to
		noise ratio.
