		Accurate Numerical Derivatives // Methods for calculating
		(usually) accurate numerical first and second order
		derivatives. Accurate calculations are done using
		'Richardson''s' extrapolation or, when applicable, a complex
		step derivative is available. A simple difference method is
		also provided. Simple difference is (usually) less accurate but
		is much quicker than 'Richardson''s' extrapolation and provides
		a useful cross-check. Methods are provided for real scalar and
		vector valued functions.
