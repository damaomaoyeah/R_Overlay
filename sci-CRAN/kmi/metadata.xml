		Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation for the analysis of cumulative
		incidence functions in the competing risks setting // The
		package performs a Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation to recover
		the missing potential censoring information from competing
		risks events, so that standard right-censored methods could be
		applied to the imputed data sets to perform analyses of the
		cumulative incidence functions.
