		Pre-Processing and Analysis of Mid-Infrared Spectral Region //
		Functions to manipulate, pre-process and analyze spectra in the
		mid-infrared region. The pre-processing of the mid-infrared
		spectra is a transcendental step in the spectral analysis.
		Preprocessing of the spectra includes smoothing, offset,
		baseline correction, and normalization,  is performed before
		the analysis of the spectra and is essential to obtain
		conclusive results in subsequent quantitative or qualitative
		analysis. This package was supported by FONDECYT 3150630, and
		CIPA Conicyt-Regional R08C1002 is gratefully acknowledged.
