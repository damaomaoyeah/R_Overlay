		Titanic Passenger Survival Data Set // This data set provides
		information on the fate of passengers on the fatal maiden
		voyage of the ocean liner "Titanic", summarized according to
		economic status (class), sex, age and survival. Whereas the
		base R Titanic data found by calling data("Titanic") is an
		array resulting from cross-tabulating 2201 observations, these
		data sets are the individual non-aggregated observations and
		formatted in a machine learning context with a training sample,
		a testing sample, and two additional data sets that can be used
		for deeper machine learning analysis. These data sets are also
		the data sets downloaded from the Kaggle competition and thus
		lowers the barrier to entry for users new to R or machine
		learing.
