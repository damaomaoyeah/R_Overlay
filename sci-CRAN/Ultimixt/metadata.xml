		Bayesian Analysis of Location-Scale Mixture Models using a Weakly
		Informative Prior // A generic reference Bayesian analysis of
		unidimensional mixture distributions obtained by a location-
		scale parameterisation of the model is implemented. The
		including functions simulate and summarize posterior samples
		for location-scale mixture models using a weakly informative
		prior. There is no need to define priors for scale-location
		parameters except two hyperparameters in which are associated
		with a Dirichlet prior for weights and a simplex.
