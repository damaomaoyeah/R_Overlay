		Bayesian Analysis of a Non-Informative Parametrization for
		Gaussian Mixture Distributions // A generic reference Bayesian
		analysis of unidimensional mixtures of Gaussian distributions
		obtained by a location-scale parameterisation of the model is
		implemented. Included functions can be applied to produce a
		Bayesian analysis of Gaussian mixtures with an arbitrary number
		of components, with no need to define the prior distribution.
