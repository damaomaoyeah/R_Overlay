		Gauss Hermite Quadrature with pruning. // The GHQ function can be
		used to obtain the quadrature points and weights to approximate
		an integral in two or more dimensions. This function uses the
		pruning approach to eliminate that points that do not
		contribute to the approximation of the integral and increases
		computational cost. The advantage to conducting this
		elimination of points is the decrease in the number of times
		that the function of interest is evaluated. This advantage is
		crucial in mixed models in which we must address several
		integrations within an iterative process to obtain model
		parameters.
