		Package for Plotting Categorical Longitudinal and Time-Series
		Data // Methods for plotting categorical longitudinal and time-
		series data by mapping individuals to the vertical space (each
		horizontal line represents a participant), time (or repeated
		measures) to the horizontal space, categorical (or discrete)
		states as facets using color or shade, and events to points
		using plotting characters. Sorting individuals in the vertical
		space and (or) stratifying them by groups can reveal patterns
		in the changes over time.
