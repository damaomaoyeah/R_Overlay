		Interface utilities, parallel computing methods and additional
		distributions for MCMC models in JAGS // This package provides
		high-level interface utilities for Just Another Gibbs Sampler
		(JAGS).  The primary functions facilitate running parallel JAGS
		models for multiple chains, automated control of convergence
		and sample length diagnostics, evaluation of the performance of
		a model against simulated data, and compatibility with the
		WinBUGS syntax of model files with data and initial values
		lists.  Model fitting can be done locally (via the rjags
		package or separate JAGS instances) or via distributed
		computing clusters such as those provided by snow (a Simple
		Network Of Workstations), Xgrid, or other user specified
		functions.  A JAGS extension module implementing additional
		distributions for JAGS models (including the Pareto family of
		distributions) is also provided.
