		Mouse-Tracking Measures from Trajectory Data // Extract from two-
		dimensional x-y coordinates of an arm-reaching trajectory,
		several dependent measures such as area under the curve,
		latency to start the movement, x-flips, etc.; which
		characterize the action-dynamics of the response. Mainly
		developed to analyze data coming from mouse-tracking
		experiments.
