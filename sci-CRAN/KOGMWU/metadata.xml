		Functional Summary and Meta-Analysis of Gene Expression Data //
		Rank-based tests for enrichment of KOG (euKaryotic Orthologous
		Groups) classes with up- or down-regulated genes based on a
		continuous measure. The meta-analysis is based on correlation
		of KOG delta-ranks across datasets (delta-rank is the
		difference between mean rank of genes belonging to a KOG class
		and mean rank of all other genes). With binary measure (1 or 0
		to indicate significant and non-significant genes), one-tailed
		Fisher's exact test for over-representation of each KOG class
		among significant genes will be performed.
