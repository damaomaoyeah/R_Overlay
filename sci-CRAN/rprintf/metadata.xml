		Adaptive Builder for Formatted Strings // Provides a set of
		functions to facilitate building formatted strings under
		various replacement rules: C-style formatting, variable-based
		formatting, and number-based formatting. C-style formatting is
		basically identical to built-in function 'sprintf'. Variable-
		based formatting allows users to put variable names in a
		formatted string which will be replaced by variable values.
		Number-based formatting allows users to use index numbers to
		represent the corresponding argument value to appear in the
		string.
