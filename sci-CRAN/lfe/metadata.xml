		Linear Group Fixed Effects // Transforms away factors with many
		levels prior to doing an OLS. Useful for estimating linear
		models with multiple group fixed effects, and for estimating
		linear models which uses factors with many levels as pure
		control variables. Includes support for instrumental variables,
		conditional F statistics for weak instruments, robust and
		multi-way clustered standard errors, as well as limited
		mobility bias correction.
