		Meta-Analysis via a Unified Framework of Confidence Distribution
		// An implementation of an all-in-one function for a wide range
		of meta-analysis problems. It contains a single function
		gmeta() that unifies all standard meta-analysis methods and
		also several newly developed ones under a framework of
		combining confidence distributions (CDs). Specifically, the
		package can perform classical p-value combination methods (such
		as methods of Fisher, Stouffer, Tippett, etc.), fit meta-
		analysis fixed-effect and random-effects models, and
		synthesizes 2x2 tables. Furthermore, it can perform robust
		meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-
		misspecifications, and limits the impact of any unknown
		outlying studies. In addition, the package implements two exact
		meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with rare
		events (e.g., zero total event). A plot function to visualize
		individual and combined CDs through extended forest plots is
		also available.
