		Sample Size Estimation for Experimental Designs // Power analysis
		is used in the estimation of sample sizes for experimental
		designs. Most programs and R packages will only output the
		highest recommended sample size to the user. Often the user
		input can be complicated and computing multiple power analyses
		for different treatment comparisons can be time consuming. This
		package simplifies the user input and allows the user to view
		all of the sample size recommendations or just the ones they
		want to see. The calculations used to calculate the recommended
		sample sizes are from the 'pwr' package.
