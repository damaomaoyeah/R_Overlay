		Spatial Point Pattern Analysis, Model-Fitting, Simulation, Tests
		// Comprehensive toolbox for analysing spatial data, mainly
		Spatial Point Patterns, including multitype/marked points and
		spatial covariates, in any two-dimensional spatial region. Also
		supports three-dimensional point patterns, space-time point
		patterns in any number of dimensions, and point patterns on a
		linear network. Contains about 2000 functions for plotting
		spatial data, exploratory data analysis, model-fitting,
		simulation, spatial sampling, model diagnostics, and formal
		inference. Data types include point patterns, line segment
		patterns, spatial windows, pixel images, tessellations, and
		linear networks. Exploratory methods include quadrat counts,
		K-functions and their simulation envelopes, nearest neighbour
		distance and empty space statistics, Fry plots, pair
		correlation function, kernel smoothed intensity, relative risk
		estimation with cross-validated bandwidth selection, mark
		correlation functions, segregation indices, mark dependence
		diagnostics, and kernel estimates of covariate effects. Formal
		hypothesis tests of random pattern (chi-squared, Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov, Diggle-Cressie-Loosmore-Ford, Dao-Genton) and tests
		for covariate effects (Cox-Berman-Waller-Lawson, Kolmogorov-
		Smirnov) are also supported. Parametric models can be fitted to
		point pattern data using the functions ppm, kppm, slrm similar
		to glm. Types of models include Poisson, Gibbs, Cox and cluster
		point processes. Models may involve dependence on covariates,
		interpoint interaction, cluster formation and dependence on
		marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic
		regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods.
		Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically.
		Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported
		(likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo
		tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise,
		AIC). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation
		envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage
		and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added
		variable plots.
