		A Faster 'ARFF' File Reader and Writer // Reads and writes 'ARFF'
		files. 'ARFF' (Attribute-Relation File Format) files are like
		'CSV' files, with a little bit of added meta information in a
		header and standardized NA values. They are quite often used
		for machine learning data sets and were introduced for the
		'WEKA' machine learning 'Java' toolbox. See
		http://weka.wikispaces.com/ARFF for further info on 'ARFF' and
		for http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ for more info on
		'WEKA'. 'farff' gets rid of the 'Java' dependency that 'RWeka'
		enforces, and it is at least a faster reader (for bigger
		files). It uses 'readr' as parser back-end for the data section
		of the 'ARFF' file. Consistency with 'RWeka' is tested on
		'Github' and 'Travis CI' with hundreds of 'ARFF' files from
		'OpenML'. Note that the 'OpenML' package is currently only
		available from 'Github' at: https://github.com/openml/openml-r.
