		Multilevel Modeling of Dendroclimatical Fluctuations //
		Multilevel data frames of tree rings and climate are modeled
		into normalized fluctuations of tree growth and aridity.
		Modeled fluctuations (model frames) are compared with Mantel
		correlograms on multiple levels defined by sample design.
		Package implementation can be understood by running examples in
		functions ringApply(), modelFrame(), and muleMan().
