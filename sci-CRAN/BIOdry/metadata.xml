		Multilevel Modeling of Dendroclimatical Fluctuations //
		Multilevel ecological data series (MEDS) are sequences of
		observations ordered according to temporal/spatial hierarchies
		that are defined by sample designs, with sample variability
		confined to ecological factors. Dendroclimatic MEDS of tree
		rings and climate are modeled into normalized fluctuations of
		tree growth and aridity.  Modeled fluctuations (model frames)
		are compared with Mantel correlograms on multiple levels
		defined by sample design. Package implementation can be
		understood by running examples in modelFrame(), and muleMan()
		functions.
