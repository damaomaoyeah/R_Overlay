		Create Waffle Chart Visualizations in R // Square pie charts
		(a.k.a. waffle charts) can be used to communicate parts of a
		whole for categorical quantities. To emulate the percentage
		view of a pie chart, a 10x10 grid should be used with each
		square representing 1% of the total. Modern uses of waffle
		charts do not necessarily adhere to this rule and can be
		created with a grid of any rectangular shape. Best practices
		suggest keeping the number of categories small, just as should
		be done when creating pie charts.
