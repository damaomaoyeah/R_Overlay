		Visualization, analysis and adjustment of high-dimensional data
		in respect to sample annotations. // The package contains
		functions to connect the structure of the data with the
		information on the samples. Three types of associations are
		covered: 1. linear model of principal components. 2.
		hierarchical clustering analysis. 3. distribution of features-
		sample annotation associations. Additionally, the inter-
		relation between sample annotations can be analyzed. Simple
		methods are provided for the correction of batch effects and
		removal of principal components.
