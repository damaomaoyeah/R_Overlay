		R Actuarial Workshops // In order to facilitate R instruction for
		actuaries, we have organized several sets of publicly available
		data of interest to non-life actuaries. In addition, we suggest
		a set of packages, which most practicing actuaries will use
		routinely. Finally, there is an R markdown skeleton for basic
		reserve analysis.
