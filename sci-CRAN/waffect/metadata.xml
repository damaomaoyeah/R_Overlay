		A package to simulate constrained phenotypes under a disease
		model H1 // waffect (pronounced 'double-u affect' for 'weighted
		affectation') is a package to simulate phenotypic (case or
		control) datasets under a disease model H1 such that the total
		number of cases is constant across all the simulations (the
		constrain in the title). The package also makes it possible to
		generate phenotypes in the case of more than two classes, so
		that the number of phenotypes belonging to each class is
		constant across all the simulations. waffect is used to assess
		empirically the statistical power of Genome Wide Association
		studies.
