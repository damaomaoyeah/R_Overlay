		Ensemble bagging and boosting classifiers // bagRboostR is a set
		of ensemble classifiers for multinomial classification. The
		bagging function is the implementation of Breiman's ensemble as
		described by Opitz  Maclin (1999). The boosting function is the
		implementation of Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multi-
		class Exponential loss function (SAMME) created by Zhu et al
		(2006). Both bagging and SAMME implementations use randomForest
		as the weak classifier and expect a character outcome variable.
		Each ensemble classifier returns a character vector of
		predictions for the test set.
