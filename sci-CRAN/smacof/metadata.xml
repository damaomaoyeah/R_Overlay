		Multidimensional Scaling in R: SMACOF. // This package provides
		the following approaches of multidimensional scaling (MDS)
		based on stress minimization by means of majorization (smacof):
		Simple smacof (basic MDS) on symmetric dissimilarity matrices,
		smacof for rectangular matrices (unfolding models), smacof with
		constraints on the configuration, three-way smacof for
		individual differences (including constraints for idioscal,
		indscal, and identity), and spherical smacof (primal and dual
		algorithm). The MDS type can be ratio, interval, ordinal manner
		(including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches for tie
		handling), and msplines. Jackknife and permutation tests are
		provided.
