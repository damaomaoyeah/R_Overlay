		Multidimensional Scaling // Provides the following approaches for
		multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on stress minimization by
		means of majorization (smacof): basic MDS on symmetric
		dissimilarity matrices, MDS with external constraints on the
		configuration, individual difference scaling (idioscal,
		indscal, and friends), MDS with spherical restrictions, and
		unfolding. The MDS type can be ratio, interval, ordinal, and
		monotone splines. Various tools and extensions like jackknife
		MDS, permutation tests, gravity models, inverse MDS,
		unidimensional scaling, classical scaling, and Procrustes.
