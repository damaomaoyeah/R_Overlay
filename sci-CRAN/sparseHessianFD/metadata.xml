		Numerical estimation of sparse Hessians using ACM TOMS Algorithm
		636. // Computes Hessian of a scalar-valued function, and
		returns it in sparse Matrix format. The user must supply the
		objective function, the gradient, and the row and column
		indices of the non-zero elements of the lower triangle of the
		Hessian (i.e., the sparsity structure must be known in
		advance). The algorithm exploits this sparsity, so Hessians can
		be computed quickly even when the number of arguments to the
		objective functions is large. This package is intended to be
		useful for numeric optimization (e.g., with the trustOptim
		package) or in simulation (e.g., the sparseMVN package). The
		underlying algorithm is ACM TOMS Algorithm 636, written by
		Coleman, Garbow and More (ACM Transactions on Mathematical
		Software, 11:4, Dec. 1985).
