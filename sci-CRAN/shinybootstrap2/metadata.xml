		Bootstrap 2 Web Components for Use with Shiny // Provides
		Bootstrap 2 web components for use with the Shiny package. With
		versions of Shiny prior to 0.11, these Bootstrap 2 components
		were included as part of the package. Later versions of Shiny
		include Bootstrap 3, so the Bootstrap 2 components have been
		moved into this package for those uses who rely on features
		specific to Bootstrap 2.
