		Quick Response Code (QR Code) / Matrix Barcode Creator // Quick
		Response codes (QR codes) are a type of matrix bar code and can
		be used to authenticate transactions, provide access to multi-
		factor authentication services and enable general data transfer
		in an image. QR codes use four standardized encoding modes
		(numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to efficiently
		store data. Matrix barcode generation is performed efficiently
		in C via the included 'libqrencoder' library created by Kentaro
		Fukuchi.
