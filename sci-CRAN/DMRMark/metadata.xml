		DMR Detection by Non-Homogeneous Hidden Markov Model from
		Methylation Array Data // Perform differential analysis for
		methylation array data. Detect differentially methylated
		regions (DMRs) from array M-values. The core is a Non-
		homogeneous Hidden Markov Model for estimating spatial
		correlation and a novel Constrained Gaussian Mixture Model for
		modeling the M-value pairs of each individual locus.
