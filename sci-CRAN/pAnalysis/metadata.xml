		Benchmarking and Rescaling R2 using Noise Percentile Analysis //
		Provides the tools needed to benchmark the R2 value
		corresponding to a certain acceptable noise level while also
		providing a rescaling function based on that noise level
		yielding a new value of R2 we refer to as R2k which is
		independent of both the number of degrees of freedom and the
		noise distribution function.
