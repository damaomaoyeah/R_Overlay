		Online Unsupervised Outlier Detection Using Finite Mixtures with
		Discounting Learning Algorithms // Addressing the problem of
		outlier detection from the viewpoint of statistical learning
		theory. This method is proposed by Yamanishi, K., Takeuchi, J.,
		Williams, G. et al. (2004)
		DOI:10.1023/B:DAMI.0000023676.72185.7c. It learns the
		probabilistic model (using a finite mixture model) through an
		on-line unsupervised process. After each datum is input, a
		score will be given with a high one indicating a high
		possibility of being a statistical outlier.
