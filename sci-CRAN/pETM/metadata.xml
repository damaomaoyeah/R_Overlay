		Penalized Exponential Tilt Model // In analysis of high-
		dimensional DNA methylation data, a penalized exponential tilt
		model can identify differentially methylated loci between cases
		and controls, using network based regularization. It is able to
		detect any differences in means only, in variances only or in
		both means and variances.
