		Construct, Evaluate and Plot Value and Utility Functions //
		Construct and plot objective hierarchies and associated value
		and utility functions. Evaluate the values and utilities and
		visualize the results as colored objective hierarchies or
		tables. Visualize uncertainty by plotting median and quantile
		intervals within the nodes of objective hierarchies. Get
		numerical results of the evaluations in standard R data types
		for further processing.
