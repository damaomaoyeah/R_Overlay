		R Object-Oriented Programming with or without References //
		Methods and classes for object-oriented programming in R with
		or without references.  Large effort has been made on making
		definition of methods as simple as possible with a minimum of
		maintenance for package developers.  The package has been
		developed since 2001 and is now considered very stable.  This
		is a cross-platform package implemented in pure R that defines
		standard S3 classes without any tricks.
