		Co-Operation: Fast Covariance, Correlation, and Cosine Similarity
		Operations // Fast implementations of the co-operations:
		covariance, correlation, and cosine similarity.  The
		implementations are fast and memory-efficient and their use is
		resolved automatically based on the input data, handled by R's
		S3 methods.  Full descriptions of the algorithms and benchmarks
		are available in the package vignettes.
