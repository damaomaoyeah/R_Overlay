		Generate fractal time series with non-normal returns distribution
		// The basic principle driving fractal generation of time
		series is that data is generated iteratively based on
		increasing levels of resolution.  The initial series is defined
		by a so-called initiator pattern and then generators are used
		to replace each segment of the initial pattern. Regular,
		repeatable patterns can be produced by using the same seed and
		generators.  By using a set of generators, non-repeatable time
		series can be produced.  This technique is the basis of the
		fractal time series process in this package.
