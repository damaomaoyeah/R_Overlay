		Theoretical Model to Simulate Radical Polymerization // A
		theoretical model to simulate  radical polymerization.
		Material, energy and population balances are integrated for
		batch, semi batch and continuous process in a ideally mixed
		reactor. Limitations: single monomer (i.e.homo polymer), one
		phase (organic, aqueous). Datasets with chemical-physical data
		for the most common monomers is included. Some background in
		polymer science is suggested for its use. Graphical interface
		for a quick and friendly use is available.
