		Markov-Switching, Bayesian, Vector Autoregression Models //
		Provides methods for estimating frequentist and Bayesian Vector
		Autoregression (VAR) models and Markov-switching Bayesian VAR
		(MSBVAR).  Functions for reduced form and structural VAR models
		are also available. Includes methods for the generating
		posterior inferences for these models, forecasts, impulse
		responses (using likelihood-based error bands), and forecast
		error decompositions.  Also includes utility functions for
		plotting forecasts and impulse responses, and generating draws
		from Wishart and singular multivariate normal densities.
		Current version includes functionality to build and evaluate
		models with Markov switching.
