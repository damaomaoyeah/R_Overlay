		Hierarchical Bayesian Model for a Hazard Function // Fits a
		piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a
		Hierarchical Bayesian model with an Intrinsic Conditional
		Autoregressive formulation for the spatial dependency in the
		hazard rates for each piece. This function uses Metropolis-
		Hastings-Green MCMC to allow the number of split points to
		vary. This function outputs graphics that display the histogram
		of the number of split points and the trace plots of the
		hierarchical parameters. The function outputs a list that
		contains the posterior samples for the number of split points,
		the location of the split points, and the log hazard rates
		corresponding to these splits. Additionally, this outputs the
		posterior samples of the two hierarchical parameters, Mu and
		Sigma^2.
