		Efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and WAIC for Bayesian
		Models // We efficiently approximate leave-one-out cross-
		validation (LOO) using very good importance sampling (VGIS), a
		new procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a
		byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate
		standard errors for estimated predictive errors, and for the
		comparison of predictive errors between two models. We also
		compute the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC).
