		Efficient Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation and WAIC for Bayesian
		Models // Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation
		(LOO) using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new
		procedure for regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct
		of the calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors
		for estimated predictive errors and for the comparison of
		predictive errors between models. We also compute the widely
		applicable information criterion (WAIC).
