		Set Data Visualization Using Hierarchies // Pure set data
		visualization approaches are often limited in scalability due
		to the combinatorial explosion of distinct set families as the
		number of sets under investigation increases. hierarchicalSets
		applies a set centric hierarchical clustering of the sets under
		investigation and uses this hierarchy as a basis for a range of
		scalable visual representations. hierarchicalSets is especially
		well suited for collections of sets that describe comparable
		comparable entities as it relies on the sets to have a
		meaningful relational structure.
