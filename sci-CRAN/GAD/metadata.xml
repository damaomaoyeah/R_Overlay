		GAD: Analysis of variance from general principles // This package
		analyses complex ANOVA models with any combination of
		orthogonal/nested and fixed/random factors, as described by
		Underwood (1997). There are two restrictions: (i) data must be
		balanced; (ii) fixed nested factors are not allowed.
		Homogeneity of variances is checked using Cochran's C test and
		'a posteriori' comparisons of means are done using Student-
		Newman-Keuls (SNK) procedure.
