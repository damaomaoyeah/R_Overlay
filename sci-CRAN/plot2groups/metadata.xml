		Plot scatter points for two groups of values // A function to
		plot scatter points for two groups of values.  It
		simultaneously calculates a P value of t-test and incorporate
		the P value into the plot.  Its advantage is jittering the
		adjacent points side by side to avoid or reduce overlapping in
		the plot.
