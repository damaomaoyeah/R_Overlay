		Calculating Effective Sizes Based on Known Demographic Parameters
		of a Population // Effective population sizes (often
		abbreviated as "Neff") are essential in biodiversity monitoring
		and conservation. For the first time, calculating effective
		sizes with data obtained within less than a generation but
		considering demographic parameters is possible. This individual
		based model uses demographic parameters of a population to
		calculate annual effective sizes and effective population sizes
		(per generation). A defined number of alleles and loci will be
		used to simulate the genotypes of the individuals. Stepwise
		mutation rates can be included. Variations in life history
		parameters (sex ratio, sex-specific survival, recruitment rate,
		reproductive skew) are possible. These results will help
		managers to define existing populations as viable or not.
