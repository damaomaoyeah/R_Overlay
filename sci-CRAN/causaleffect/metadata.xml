		Deriving Expressions of Joint Interventional Distributions in
		Causal Models // An implementation of a conditional causal
		effect identification algorithm constructed by Ilya Shpitser
		and Judea Pearl (2006) for deriving expressions of joint
		interventional distributions in causal models, which contain
		unobserved variables and induce directed acyclic graphs.
