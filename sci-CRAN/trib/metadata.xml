		Analysing and Visualizing Tribology Measurements // Tribology
		test devices such as pin-on-disk, ball-on-disk machines and
		profilometers give important data for tribological analysis.
		trib is built to analyze and visualize that data into human
		understandable form. It has functions for finding coefficient
		of friction, Friction Force vs Distance graphs and calculating
		Wear Track Volume and Wear Track plotting.
