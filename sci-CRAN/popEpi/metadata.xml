		Functions for Epidemiological Analysis using Population Data //
		Enables computation of epidemiological statistics where e.g.
		counts or mortality rates of the reference population are used.
		Currently supported: excess hazard models, rates, mean survival
		times, relative survival, as well as standardized incidence and
		mortality ratios (SIRs/SMRs), all of which can be easily
		adjusted for e.g. age. Fast splitting and aggregation of
		'Lexis' objects (from package 'Epi') and other computations
		achieved using 'data.table'.
