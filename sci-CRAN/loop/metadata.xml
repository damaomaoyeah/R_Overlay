		loop decomposition of weighted directed graphs for life cycle
		analysis, providing flexbile network plotting methods, and
		analyzing food chain properties in ecology // The program can
		perform loop analysis and plot network structure (especially
		for food webs),including minimum spanning tree, loop
		decomposition of weighted directed graphs, and other network
		properties which may be related to food chain properties in
		ecology.
