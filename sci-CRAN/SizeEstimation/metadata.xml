		Estimating the Sizes of Populations at Risk of HIV Infection from
		Multiple Data Sources Using a Bayesian Hierarchical Model //
		This function develops an algorithm for presenting a Bayesian
		hierarchical model for estimating the sizes of local and
		national drug injected populations in Bangladesh. The model
		incorporates multiple commonly used data sources including
		mapping data, surveys, interventions, capture-recapture data,
		estimates or guesstimates from organizations, and expert
		opinion.
