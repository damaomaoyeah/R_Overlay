		Computed ABC Analysis // For a given data set, the package
		provides a novel method of computing precise limits to acquire
		subsets which are easily interpreted. Closely related to the
		Lorenz curve, the ABC curve visualizes the data by graphically
		representing the cumulative distribution function. Based on an
		ABC analysis the algorithm calculates, with the help of the ABC
		curve, the optimal limits by exploiting the mathematical
		properties pertaining to distribution of analyzed items. The
		data containing positive values is divided into three disjoint
		subsets A, B and C, with subset A comprising very profitable
		values, i.e. largest data values ("the important few"), subset
		B comprising values where the yield equals to the effort
		required to obtain it, and the subset C comprising of non-
		profitable values, i.e., the smallest data sets ("the trivial
		many"). Package is based on Ultsch. A ., Lotsch J.: Computed
		ABC Analysis for rational Selection of most informative
		Variables in multivariate Data, PLoS One, 2015.
