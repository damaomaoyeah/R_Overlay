		Diversification Rate Estimation and Fast Simulation of
		Reconstructed Phylogenetic Trees under Tree-Wide Time-
		Heterogeneous Birth-Death Processes Including Mass-Extinction
		Events // Simulation of reconstructed phylogenetic trees under
		tree-wide time-heterogeneous birth-death processes and
		estimation of diversification parameters under the same model.
		Speciation and extinction rates can be any function of time and
		mass-extinction events at specific times can be provided. Trees
		can be simulated either conditioned on the number of species,
		the time of the process, or both. Additionally, the likelihood
		equations are implemented for convenience and can be used for
		Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and Bayesian inference.
