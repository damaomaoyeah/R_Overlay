		The Random Subgraph Model // Estimate the parameters, the number
		of classes and cluster vertices of a random network into groups
		with homogeneous connection profiles. The clustering is
		performed for directed graphs with typed edges (edges are
		assumed to be drawn from multinomial distributions) for which a
		partition of the vertices is available.
