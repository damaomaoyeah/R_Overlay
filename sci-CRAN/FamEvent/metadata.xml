		Simulation of Time-to-Event Family Data and Penetrance Estimation
		// Generates time-to-event family data associated with mutated
		genes arising from various family study designs such as
		population-based, clinic- based, or multi-stage designs and
		provides functions to fit family data accounting for the study
		design and estimate age-dependent penetrance functions. It also
		provides carrier probabilities for those with missing genotypes
		and penetrance estimations are based on an Expectation-
		Maximization algorithm when genotypes are missing.
