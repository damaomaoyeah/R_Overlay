		Family Age-at-Onset Data Simulation and Penetrance Estimation //
		Simulates age-at-onset traits associated with a segregating
		major gene in family data obtained from population-based,
		clinic-based, or multi-stage designs. Appropriate ascertainment
		correction is utilized to estimate age-dependent penetrance
		functions either parametrically from the fitted model or
		nonparametrically from the data. The Expectation and
		Maximization algorithm can infer missing genotypes and carrier
		probabilities estimated from family's genotype and phenotype
		information or from a fitted model. Plot functions include
		pedigrees of simulated families and predicted penetrance curves
		based on specified parameter values.
