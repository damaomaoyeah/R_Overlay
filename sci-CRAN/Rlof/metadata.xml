		R Parallel Implementation of Local Outlier Factor(LOF) // R
		parallel implementation of Local Outlier Factor(LOF) which uses
		multiple CPUs to significantly speed up the LOF computation for
		large datasets. (Note: The overall performance depends on the
		computers especially the number of the cores).It also supports
		multiple k values to be calculated in parallel, as well as
		various distance measures in addition to the default Euclidean
		distance.
