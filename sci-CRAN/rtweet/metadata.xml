		Collecting Twitter Data // An implementation of calls designed to
		extract and organize Twitter data via Twitter's REST and stream
		APIs. Functions formulate GET and POST requests and convert
		response objects to more user friendly structures, e.g., data
		frames or lists. Specific consideration is given to functions
		designed to return tweets, friends, and followers.
