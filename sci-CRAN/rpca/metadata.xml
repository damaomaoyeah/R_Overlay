		RobustPCA: Decompose a Matrix into Low-Rank and Sparse Components
		// Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of
		a low-rank component and a sparse component. Candes, E. J., Li,
		X., Ma, Y.,  Wright, J. (2011). Robust principal component
		analysis?. Journal of the ACM (JACM), 58(3), 11. prove that we
		can recover each component individually under some suitable
		assumptions. It is possible to recover both the low-rank and
		the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient
		convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all
		feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination
		of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm. This package implements
		this decomposition algorithm resulting with Robust PCA
		approach.
