		MVPARTwrap: Additional features for package mvpart. // The main
		function of this package, MRT, provides to the following
		information : the proper cluster membership allocation in the
		tree, the discriminant species for each cluster, the tree nodes
		at the proper level of R2 (1-relative error), the total species
		variance partitioned by species, by the tree, and by the splits
		of the tree, plus a different graphic representation of the
		final model in the form of a tree. Moreover, the CascadeMRT
		function allows a cascade MRT analysis and the CasMRTR2
		function allows to illustrate the (unadjusted) variation
		explained by each wave/drops. Last but not least, the R2aGDF
		function permits the calculation of an adjusted R^2 for an MRT
		model.
