		Propensity score methods for assigning treatment in randomized
		trials // This package contains functions to run propensity-
		biased allocation to balance covariate distributions in
		sequential trials and propensity-constrained randomization to
		balance covariate distributions in trials with known baseline
		covariates at time of randomization.  Currently this package
		only supports trials comparing two groups.
