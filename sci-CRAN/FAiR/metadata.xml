		Factor Analysis in R // This package estimates factor analysis
		models using a genetic algorithm, which permits a general
		mechanism for restricted optimization with arbitrary
		restrictions that are chosen at run time with the help of a
		GUI. Importantly, inequality restrictions can be imposed on
		functions of multiple parameters, which provides a new avenues
		for testing and generating theories with factor analysis
		models. This package also includes an entirely new estimator of
		the common factor analysis model called semi-exploratory factor
		analysis, which is a general alternative to exploratory and
		confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, this package integrates
		a lot of other packages that estimate sample covariance
		matrices and thus provides a lot of alternatives to the
		traditional sample covariance calculation. Note that you need
		to have the Gtk run time library installed on your system to
		use this package; see the URL below for detailed installation
		instructions. Most users would only need to understand the
		first twenty-four pages of the PDF manual.
