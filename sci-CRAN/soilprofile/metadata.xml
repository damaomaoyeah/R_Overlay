		A package to consistently represent soil properties along a soil
		profile // This package provides functions to graphically
		represent soil properties. Morphological data gathered in the
		field such as horizon boundaries, root abundance and
		dimensions, skeletal shape, abundance and dimension as well as
		meaningful soil color may be represented via the plot function.
		A lattice-based plot.element function has been designed to
		represent depth function of a given variable.
