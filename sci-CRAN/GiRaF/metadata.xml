		Gibbs Random Fields Analysis // Allows calculation on, and
		sampling from Gibbs Random Fields, and more precisely general
		homogeneous Potts model. The primary tool is the exact
		computation of the intractable normalising constant for small
		rectangular lattices. Beside the latter function, it contains
		method that give exact sample from the likelihood for small
		enough rectangular lattices or approximate sample from the
		likelihood using MCMC samplers for large lattices.
