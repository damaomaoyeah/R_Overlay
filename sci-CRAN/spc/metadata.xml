		Statistical Process Control -- Collection of Some Useful
		Functions // Evaluation of control charts by means of the zero-
		state, steady-state ARL (Average Run Length) and RL quantiles.
		Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL. The control
		charts under consideration are one- and two-sided EWMA, CUSUM,
		and Shiryaev-Roberts schemes for monitoring the mean of
		normally distributed independent data. ARL calculation of the
		same set of schemes under drift are added. Other charts and
		parameters are in preparation. Further SPC areas will be
		covered as well (sampling plans, capability indices ...).
