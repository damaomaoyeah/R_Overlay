		Routines for fitting kinetic models with one or more state
		variables to chemical degradation data // Calculation routines
		based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006). Includes a function
		for conveniently defining differential equation models, model
		solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical
		solvers and a choice of the optimisation methods made available
		by the FME package (default is a Levenberg-Marquardt variant).
		Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of
		results or fitness for a particular purpose.
