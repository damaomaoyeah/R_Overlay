		Calculate normalising constants for Bayesian time series models.
		// The tsbridge package contains a collection of R functions
		that can be used to estimate normalising constants using the
		bridge sampler of Meng and Wong (1996). The functions can be
		applied to calculate posterior model probabilities for a
		variety of time series Bayesian models, where parameters are
		estimated using BUGS, and models themselves are created using
		the tsbugs package.
