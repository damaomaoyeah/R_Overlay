		Spatio-Temporal Fixation Pattern Analysis // Spatio-temporal
		Fixation Pattern Analysis (FPA) is a new method of analyzing
		eye movement data, developed by Mr. Jinlu Cao under the
		supervision of Prof. Chen Hsuan-Chih at The Chinese University
		of Hong Kong, and Prof. Wang Suiping at the South China Normal
		Univeristy. The package "fpa" is a R implementation which makes
		FPA analysis much easier. There are four major functions in the
		package: ft2fp(), get_pattern(), plot_pattern(), and
		lineplot(). The function ft2fp() is the core function, which
		can complete all the preprocessing within moments. The other
		three functions are supportive functions which visualize the
		eye fixation patterns.
