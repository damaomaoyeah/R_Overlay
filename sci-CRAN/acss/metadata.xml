		Algorithmic Complexity for Short Strings // Main functionality is
		to provide the algorithmic complexity for short strings, an
		approximation of the Kolmogorov Complexity of a short string
		using the coding theorem method (see ?acss). The database
		containing the complexity is provided in the data only package
		acss.data, this package provides functions accessing the data
		such as prob_random returning the posterior probability that a
		given string was produced by a random process. In addition, two
		traditional (but problematic) measures of complexity are also
		provided: entropy and change complexity.
