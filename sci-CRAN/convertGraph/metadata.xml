		Convert Graphical Files Format // Converts graphical file formats
		(SVG, PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, PDF, etc) to one another. The
		exceptions are the SVG file format that can only be converted
		to other formats and in contrast, PDF format, which can only be
		created from others graphical formats. The main purpose of the
		package was to provide a solution for converting SVG file
		format to PNG which is often needed for exporting graphical
		files produced by R widgets.
