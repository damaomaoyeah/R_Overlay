		Extensible Classes and Methods for Penalized-Regression-Based
		Integration of Base Learners // Extending the base classes and
		methods of EnsembleBase package for Penalized-Regression-based
		(Ridge and Lasso) integration of base learners. Default
		implementation uses cross-validation error to choose the
		optimal lambda (shrinkage parameter) for the final predictor.
		The package takes advantage of the file method provided in
		EnsembleBase package for writing estimation objects to disk in
		order to circumvent RAM bottleneck. Special save and load
		methods are provided to allow estimation objects to be saved to
		permanent files on disk, and to be loaded again into temporary
		files in a later R session. Users and developers can extend the
		package by extending the generic methods and classes provided
		in EnsembleBase package as well as this package.
