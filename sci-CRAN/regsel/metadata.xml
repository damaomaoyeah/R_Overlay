		Variable Selection and Regression // Functions for fitting linear
		and generalized linear models with variable selection. The
		functions can automatically do Stepwise Regression, Lasso or
		Elastic Net as variable selection methods. Lasso and Elastic
		net are improved and handle factors better (they can either
		include or exclude all factor levels).
