		Fragment Analysis in R // Performs fragment analysis using
		genetic data coming from capillary electrophoresis machines.
		These are files with FSA extension which stands for FASTA-type
		file and contains DNA fragment intensities read by machinery.
		In addition to visualization, it performs automatic scoring of
		SSRs (Sample Sequence Repeats; a type of genetic marker very
		common across the genome) and other type of PCR markers
		(standing for Polymerase Chain Reaction) in biparental
		populations such as F1, F2, BC (backcross), and diversity
		panels (collection of genetic diversity).
