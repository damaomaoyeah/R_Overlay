		Mapping Smoothed Effect Estimates from Individual-Level Data //
		Contains functions for mapping odds ratios or other effect
		estimates using individual-level data such as case-control
		study data, using generalized additive models (GAMs) for
		smoothing with a two-dimensional predictor (e.g., geolocation
		or exposure to chemical mixtures) while adjusting for
		confounding variables, using methods described by Kelsall and
		Diggle (1998) and Webster at al. (2006).  Includes convenient
		functions for mapping, efficient control sampling, and
		permutation tests for the null hypothesis that the two-
		dimensional predictor is not associated with the outcome
		variable (adjusting for confounders).
