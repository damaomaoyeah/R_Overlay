		Variational inference for Bayesian variable selection //
		Implements the variational inference procedure for Bayesian
		variable selection, as described in the "Scalable variational
		inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression, and
		its accuracy in genetic association studies" (Bayesian Analysis
		7, March 2012, pages 73-108). This software has been used to
		implement Bayesian variable selection for large problems with
		over a million variables and thousands of samples.
