		Large-Scale Bayesian Variable Selection Using Variational Methods
		// Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection
		models and computing Bayes factors, in which the outcome (or
		response variable) is modeled using a linear regression or a
		logistic regression. The algorithms are based on the
		variational approximations described in "Scalable variational
		inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression, and
		its accuracy in genetic association studies" (P. Carbonetto  M.
		Stephens, 2012, DOI:10.1214/12-BA703). This software has been
		applied to large data sets with over a million variables and
		thousands of samples.
