		Hidden Markov Models for Life Sequences and Other Multivariate,
		Multichannel Categorical Time Series // Designed for fitting
		hidden (latent) Markov models and mixture hidden Markov models
		for social sequence data and other categorical time series.
		Also some more restricted versions of these type of models are
		available: Markov models, mixture Markov models, and latent
		class models. The package supports models for one or multiple
		subjects with one or multiple parallel sequences (channels).
		External covariates can be added to explain cluster membership
		in mixture models. The package provides functions for
		evaluating and comparing models, as well as functions for easy
		plotting of multichannel sequence data and hidden Markov
		models. Models are estimated using maximum likelihood via the
		EM algorithm and/or direct numerical maximization with
		analytical gradients. All main algorithms are written in C++
		with support for parallel computation.
