		Statistical Comparison of Two Networks Based on Three Invariance
		Measures // This permutation based hypothesis test, suited for
		Gaussian and binary data, assesses the difference between two
		networks based on several invariance measures (network
		structure invariance, global strength invariance, edge
		invariance). Network structures are estimated with
		l1-regularized partial correlations (Gaussian data) or with
		l1-regularized logistic regression (eLasso, binary data).
		Suited for comparison of independent and dependent samples
		(currently, only for one group measured twice).
