		Semi-Supervised Learning // Semi-supervised learning has
		attracted the attention of machine learning community because
		of its high accuracy with less annotating effort compared with
		supervised learning.The question that semi-supervised learning
		wants to address is: given a relatively small labeled dataset
		and a large unlabeled dataset, how to design classification
		algorithms learning from both ? This package is a collection of
		some classical semi-supervised learning algorithms in the last
		few decades.
