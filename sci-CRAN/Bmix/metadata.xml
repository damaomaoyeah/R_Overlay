		Bayesian Sampling for Stick-Breaking Mixtures // This is a bare-
		bones implementation of sampling algorithms for a variety of
		Bayesian stick-breaking (marginally DP) mixture models,
		including particle learning and Gibbs sampling for static DP
		mixtures, particle learning for dynamic BAR stick-breaking, and
		DP mixture regression.  The software is designed to be easy to
		customize to suit different situations and for experimentation
		with stick-breaking models.  Since particles are repeatedly
		copied, it is not an especially efficient implementation.
