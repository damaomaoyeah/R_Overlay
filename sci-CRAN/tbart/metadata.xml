		Teitz and Bart's p-Median Algorithm // Solves Teitz and Bart's
		p-median problem - given a set of points attempts to find
		subset of size p such that summed distances of any point in the
		set to the nearest point in p is minimised.  Although generally
		effective, this algorithm does not guarantee that a globally
		optimal subset is found.
