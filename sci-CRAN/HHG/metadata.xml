		Heller-Heller-Gorfine Tests of Independence and Equality of
		Distributions // Heller-Heller-Gorfine ('HHG') tests are a set
		of powerful statistical tests of multivariate k-sample
		homogeneity and independence. For the univariate case, the
		package also offers implementations of the 'MinP DDP' and 'MinP
		ADP' tests, which are consistent against all continuous
		alternatives but are distribution-free, and are thus much
		faster to apply.
