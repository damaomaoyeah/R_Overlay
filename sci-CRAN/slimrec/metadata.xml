		Sparse Linear Method to Predict Ratings and Top-N Recommendations
		// Sparse Linear Method(SLIM) predicts ratings and top-n
		recommendations suited for sparse implicit positive feedback
		systems. SLIM is decomposed into multiple elasticnet
		optimization problems which are solved in parallel over
		multiple cores. The package is based on "SLIM: Sparse Linear
		Methods for Top-N Recommender Systems" by Xia Ning and George
		Karypis doi:10.1109/ICDM.2011.134.
