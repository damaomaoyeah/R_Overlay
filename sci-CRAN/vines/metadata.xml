		Multivariate Dependence Modeling with Vines // Implementation of
		the vine graphical model for building high-dimensional
		distributions as a factorization of bivariate copulas and
		marginal density functions. This package provides S4 classes
		for vines (C-vines and D-vines) and methods for inference,
		goodness-of-fit tests, density/distribution function
		evaluation, and simulation.
