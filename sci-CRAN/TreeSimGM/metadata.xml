		Simulating Phylogenetic Trees under a General Model // The
		package is a flexible simulation tool for phylogenetic trees
		under a general model. It is possible to assume any probability
		distribution for the waiting time until speciation and
		extinction independently. Thus, TreeSimGM allows to simulate
		stochastic phylogenetic trees using any probability
		distribution and parameters for speciation and  extinction. The
		speciation modes have all binary splits and are: (i) symmetric,
		where for every speciation event new waiting times until
		speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages;
		and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one
		species with new waiting times, and another that carries the
		extinction time and age of its ancestor. Those two modes were
		inspired by allopatric and peripatric speciation
		respectively.Both models (symmetric and asymmetric) were
		created and implemented so that different processes
		(distributions) for speciation and extinction could be
		independently and explicitly specified. It is also possible to
		have an implicit extinction process by setting the extinction
		rate to zero.
