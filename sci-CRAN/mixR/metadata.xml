		Finite Mixture Modeling for Raw and Binned Data // Performs
		maximum likelihood estimation for finite mixture models for
		families including Normal, Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal by
		using EM algorithm, together with Newton-Raphson algorithm or
		bisection method when necessary. It also conducts mixture model
		selection by using information criteria or bootstrap likelihood
		ratio test. The data used for mixture model fitting can be raw
		data or binned data. The model fitting process is accelerated
		by using R package 'Rcpp'.
