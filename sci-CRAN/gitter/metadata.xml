		An R Package for Quantification of Pinned Microbial Culture //
		The goal of this package is to allow users to robustly and
		quickly grid and quantify sizes of pinned colonies in plate
		images. gitter works by first finding the grid of colonies from
		a preprocessed image and then locating the bounds of each
		colony separately. It includes several image pre-processing
		techniques, such as autorotation of plates, noise removal,
		contrast adjustment and image resizing.
