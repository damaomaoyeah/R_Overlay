		Interface to the Agave API // Provides an interface to the the
		many computational resources iPlant offers through their
		RESTful application programming interface, see
		http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ for more information about
		iPlant, and http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/iplant-
		science-apis for its APIs.  Currently, 'rPlant' functions
		interact with the iPlant Agave API, the Taxonomic Name
		Resolution Service API, and the Phylotastic Taxosaurus API.
		Before using 'rPlant', users will have to register with the
		iPlant Collaborative.  See http://agaveapi.co/ for more
		information on the Agave API and
		http://user.iplantcollaborative.org/ to register with iPlant.
