		Improved Communication to Users with Respect to Problems in
		Function Arguments // The typical process of checking arguments
		in functions is iterative.  In this process, an error may be
		returned and the user may fix it only to receive another error
		on a different argument.  'ArgumentCheck' facilitates a more
		helpful way to perform argument checks allowing the programmer
		to run all of the checks and then return all of the errors and
		warnings in a single message.
