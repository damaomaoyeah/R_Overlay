		Rcpp integration of different Ziggurat Normal RNG implementations
		// The Ziggurat generator for normally distributed random
		numbers, originally proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang (JSS,
		2000), has been improved upon a few times starting with Leong
		et al (JSS, 2005). This package provides an aggregation in
		order to compare different implementations. The goal is to
		provide an 'faster but good enough' alternative for use with R
		and C++ code. . The package is still in an early state. Unless
		you know what you are doing, sticking with the generators
		provided by R may be a good idea as these have been extremely
		diligently tested.
