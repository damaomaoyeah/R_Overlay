		Fast load variables // The purpose of this package is to be able
		to save and load only the needed variables/columns of a
		dataframe in special binary files (tar archives) - which seems
		to be a lot faster method than loading the whole binary object
		(RData files) via load() function, or than loading columns from
		SQLite/MySQL databases via SQL commands (see vignettes).
		Performance gain on SSD drives is a lot more sensible compared
		to basic load() function. The performance improvement gained by
		loading only the chosen variables in binary format can be
		useful in some special cases (e.g. where merging data tables is
		not an option and very different datasets are needed for
		reporting), but be sure if using this package that you really
		need this, as non-standard file formats are used!
