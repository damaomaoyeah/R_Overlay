		Additional Matrix Functionality // Additional matrix
		functionality for R including: (1) wrappers for the base matrix
		function that allow matrices to be created from character
		strings and lists (the former is especially useful for creating
		block matrices), (2) better printing of large matrices via the
		generic "pretty" print function, and (3) a number of
		convenience functions for users more familiar with other
		scientific languages like 'Julia', 'Matlab'/'Octave', or
		'Python'+'NumPy'.
