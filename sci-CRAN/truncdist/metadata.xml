		Truncated Random Variables // A collection of tools to evaluate
		probability density functions, cumulative distribution
		functions, quantile functions and random numbers for truncated
		random variables.  These functions are provided to also compute
		the expected value and variance. Nadarajah and Kotz (2006)
		developed most of the functions. QQ plots can be produced. All
		the probability functions in the stats, stats4 and evd packages
		are automatically available for truncation..
