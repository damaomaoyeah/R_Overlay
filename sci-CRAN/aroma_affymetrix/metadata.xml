		Analysis of Large Affymetrix Microarray Data Sets // A cross-
		platform R framework that facilitates processing of any number
		of Affymetrix microarray samples regardless of computer system.
		The only parameter that limits the number of chips that can be
		processed is the amount of available disk space.  The Aroma
		Framework has successfully been used in studies to process tens
		of thousands of arrays.  This package has actively been used
		since 2006.
