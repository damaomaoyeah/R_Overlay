		The Clustering of Regression Models Method // We proposed a new
		model-based clustering method, called the clustering of
		regression models method(CORM), which groups genes that share a
		similar relationship to the covariate(s). This method provides
		a unified approach for a family of clustering procedures and
		can be applied to data collected with various experimental
		designs. This package includes the implementation for two such
		clustering procedures: (1) the Clustering of Linear Models
		(CLM) method, and (2) the Clustering of Linear Mixed Models
		(CLMM) method.
