		Spatial pattern detection in genetic distance data using Moran's
		Eigenvector Maps // Memgene can detect relatively weak spatial
		genetic patterns by using Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEM) to
		extract only the spatial component of genetic variation.
		Memgene has applications in landscape genetics where the
		movement and dispersal of organisms are studied using neutral
		genetic variation.
