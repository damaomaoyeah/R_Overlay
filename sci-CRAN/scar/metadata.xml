		Shape-Constrained Additive Regression: a Maximum Likelihood
		Approach // This package computes the maximum likelihood
		estimator of the generalised additive and index regression with
		shape constraints. Each additive component function is assumed
		to obey one of the nine possible shape restrictions: linear,
		increasing, decreasing, convex, convex increasing, convex
		decreasing, concave, concave increasing, or concave decreasing.
