		Penalized Logistic Regression Model using Majorization
		Minimization by Coordinate Descent (MMCD) Algorithm // The
		package uses majorization minimization by coordinate descent
		(MMCD) algorithm to compute the solution surface for concave
		penalized logistic regression model.  The SCAD and MCP
		(default) are two concave penalties considered in this
		implementation.  For the MCP penalty, the package also provides
		the local linear approximation by coordinate descant (LLA-CD)
		and adaptive rescaling algorithms for computing the solutions.
		The package also provides a Lasso-concave hybrid penalty for
		fast variable selection. The hybrid penalty applies the concave
		penalty only to the variables selected by the Lasso.  For all
		the implemented methods, the solution surface is computed along
		kappa, which is a more smooth fit for the logistic model.
		Tuning parameter selection method by k-fold cross-validated
		area under ROC curve (CV-AUC) is implemented as well.
