		Streamlining Design and Deployment of Complex Workflows // This
		framework allows you to design and implement complex pipelines,
		and deploy them on your institution's computing cluster. This
		has been built keeping in mind the needs of bioinformatics
		workflows. However, it is easily extendable to any field where
		a series of steps (shell commands) are to be executed in a
		(work)flow.
