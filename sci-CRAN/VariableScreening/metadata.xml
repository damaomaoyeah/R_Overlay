		High-Dimensional Screening for Semiparametric Longitudinal
		Regression // Implements a screening procedure proposed by
		Wanghuan Chu, Runze Li and Matthew Reimherr (2016)
		DOI:10.1214/16-AOAS912 for varying coefficient longitudinal
		models with ultra-high dimensional predictors . The effect of
		each predictor is allowed to vary over time, approximated by a
		low-dimensional B-spline. Within-subject correlation is handled
		using a generalized estimation equation approach with structure
		specified by the user. Variance is allowed to change over time,
		also approximated by a B-spline.
