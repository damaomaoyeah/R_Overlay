		High-Dimensional Screening for Semiparametric Longitudinal
		Regression // Implements a screening procedure proposed by Chu,
		Li, and Reimherr (2016) for varying coefficient longitudinal
		models with ultra- high dimensional predictors
		http://imstat.org/aoas/next_issue.html. The effect of each
		predictor is allowed to vary over time, approximated by a low-
		dimensional B-spline. Within-subject correlation is handled
		using a generalized estimation equation approach with structure
		specified by the user. Variance is allowed to change over time,
		also approximated by a B-spline.
