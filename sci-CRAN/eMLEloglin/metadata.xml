		Fitting log-Linear Models in Sparse Contingency Tables // Log-
		linear modeling is a popular method for the analysis of
		contingency table data. When the table is sparse, the data can
		fall on the boundary of the convex support, and we say that
		"the MLE does not exist" in the sense that some parameters
		cannot be estimated. However, an extended MLE always exists,
		and a subset of the original parameters will be estimable. The
		'eMLEloglin' package determines which sampling zeros contribute
		to the non-existence of the MLE. These problematic zero cells
		can be removed from the contingency table and the model can
		then be fit (as far as is possible) using the glm() function.
