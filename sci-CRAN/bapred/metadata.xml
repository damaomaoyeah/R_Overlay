		Batch Effect Removal (in Phenotype Prediction using Gene Data) //
		Various tools dealing with batch effects, in particular
		enabling the removal of discrepancies between training and test
		sets in prediction scenarios. The following batch effect
		removal methods are implemented: FAbatch, ComBat, (f)SVA, mean-
		centering, standardization, Ratio-A and Ratio-G. For each of
		these we provide an additional function which enables a
		posteriori ('addon') batch effect removal in independent
		batches ('test data'). Here, the (already batch effect
		adjusted) training data is not altered. For evaluating the
		success of batch effect adjustment several metrics are
		provided. Moreover, the package implements a plot for the
		visualization of batch effects using principal component
		analysis. The main functions of the package are ba() and
		baaddon() which enable batch effect removal and addon batch
		effect removal, respectively, with one of the seven methods
		mentioned above. Another important function is bametric() which
		is a wrapper function for all implemented methods for
		evaluating the success of batch effect removal.
