		Batch Effect Removal and Addon Normalization (in Phenotype
		Prediction using Gene Data) // Various tools dealing with batch
		effects, in particular enabling the removal of discrepancies
		between training and test sets in prediction scenarios.
		Moreover, addon quantile normalization and addon RMA
		normalization (Kostka  Spang, 2008) is implemented to enable
		integrating the quantile normalization step into prediction
		rules. The following batch effect removal methods are
		implemented: FAbatch, ComBat, (f)SVA, mean-centering,
		standardization, Ratio-A and Ratio-G. For each of these we
		provide  an additional function which enables a posteriori
		('addon') batch effect removal in independent batches ('test
		data'). Here, the (already batch effect adjusted) training data
		is not altered. For evaluating the success of batch effect
		adjustment several metrics are provided. Moreover, the package
		implements a plot for the visualization of batch effects using
		principal component analysis. The main functions of the package
		for batch effect adjustment are ba() and baaddon() which enable
		batch effect removal and addon batch effect removal,
		respectively, with one of the seven methods mentioned above.
		Another important function here is bametric() which is a
		wrapper function for all implemented methods for evaluating the
		success of batch effect removal. For (addon) quantile
		normalization and (addon) RMA normalization the functions
		qunormtrain(), qunormaddon(), rmatrain() and rmaaddon() can be
		used.
