		Mixed FLP and ML Estimation of ETAS Space-Time Point Processes //
		Estimation of the components of an ETAS model for earthquake
		description. Non-parametric background seismicity can be
		estimated through FLP (Forward Likelihood Predictive), while
		parametric components are estimated through maximum likelihood.
		The two estimation steps are alternated until convergence is
		obtained. For each event the probability of being a background
		event is estimated and used as a weight for declustering steps.
		Many options to control the estimation process are present,
		together with some diagnostic tools. Some descriptive functions
		for earthquakes catalogs are  present; also plot, print,
		summary, profile methods are defined for main output (objects
		of class 'etasclass').
