		strategic selection estimator. A strategic selection estimator
		is an agent error model in which the two random components are
		not assumed to be orthogonal. In addition this package provides
		generic functions to print and plot objects of its class as
		well as the necessary functions to create tables for LaTeX.
		There is also a function to create dyadic data sets.
