		Adaptive Normalization for miRNA Data // An adaptive
		normalization algorithm that selects housekeeping genes based
		on the sample level variability in the data. This is suitable
		for any data obtained from RT-qPCR assays.  A manuscript
		describing the method is submitted to Genome Biology under
		``MiRA-norm: An Adaptive Method for the Normalization of
		MicroRNA Array Data``, Yuda Zhu et al.
