		An Implementation of 'kinn' Algorithm, a Graph Based Regression
		Model // A graph based regression model from flat unstructured
		dataset. Each line in the input data set is treated as a node
		from which an edge to another line (node) can be formed. In the
		training process, a model is created which contains sparse
		graph adjacency matrix. This model is then used for prediction
		by taking a predictor and the model as inputs and outputs a
		prediction which is an average of the most similar node and its
		neighbours in the model graph.
