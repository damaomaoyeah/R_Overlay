		Admixture Graph Manipulation and Fitting // Implements tools for
		building and visualising admixture graphs and for extracting
		equations from them. These equations can be compared to f-
		statistics obtained from data to test the consistency of a
		graph against data -- for example by comparing the sign of
		f_4-statistics with the signs predicted by the graph -- and
		graph parameters (edge lengths and admixture proportions) can
		be fitted to observed statistics.
