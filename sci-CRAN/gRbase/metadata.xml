		A Package for Graphical Modelling in R // The 'gRbase' package
		provides general features which are used by other graphical
		modelling packages, in particular by the packages 'gRain',
		'gRim' and 'gRc'. . 'gRbase' contains several datasets relevant
		for use in connection with graphical models. Almost all
		datasets used in the book Graphical Models with R (2012) are
		contained in 'gRbase'. . 'gRbase' implements several graph
		algorithms (based mainly on representing graphs as adjacency
		matrices - either in the form of a standard matrix or a sparse
		matrix). Some graph algorithms are: (i) maximum cardinality
		search (for marked and unmarked graphs). (ii) moralize. (iii)
		triangulate. (iv) junction tree. . 'gRbase' facilitates array
		operations, . 'gRbase' implements functions for testing for
		conditional independence. . 'gRbase' illustrates how
		hierarchical log-linear models may be implemented and describes
		concept of graphical meta data. These features, however, are
		not maintained anymore and remains in 'gRbase' only because
		there exists a paper describing these facilities: A Common
		Platform for Graphical Models in R: The 'gRbase' Package,
		Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 14, No 17, 2005. . NOTICE
		Proper functionality of 'gRbase' requires that the packages
		graph, 'Rgraphviz' and 'RBGL' are installed from
		'bioconductor'; for installation instructions please refer to
		the webpage given below.
