		A package for graphical modelling in R // The gRbase package
		provides certain general constructs which are used by other
		graphical modelling packages, in particular by the packages
		gRain, gRim and gRc. . gRbase contains several datasets
		relevant for use in connection with graphical models. Almost
		all datasets used in the book Graphical Models with R (2012)
		are contained in gRbase. . gRbase implements several graph
		algorithms (based mainly on representing graphs as adjacency
		matrices - either in the form of a standard matrix or a sparse
		matrix). Some graph algorithms are: (i) maximum cardinality
		search (for marked and unmarked graphs). (ii) moralize. (iii)
		triangulate. (iv) junctionTree. . gRbase facilities for array
		operations, . gRbase implements functions for testing for
		conditional independence. . gRbase illustrates how hierarchical
		log-linear models (hllm) may be implemented and describes
		concept of gmData (graphical meta data). These features,
		however, are not maintained anymore and remains in gRbase only
		because there exists a paper describing these facilities: A
		Common Platform for Graphical Models in R: The gRbase Package,
		Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 14, No 17, 2005.
