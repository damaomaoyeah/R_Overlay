		Functions for Dyadic Sequence Analyses // Functions for dyadic
		binary/dichotomous sequence analyses are implemented in this
		contribution. The focus is on estimating actor-partner-
		interaction models using various approaches, for instances the
		approach of Bakeman  Gottman's (1997)
		DOI:10.1017/cbo9780511527685, generalized multi-level models,
		and basic Markov models. Moreover, coefficients of one model
		can be translated into those of the other models. Finally,
		simulation-based power analyses are provided.
