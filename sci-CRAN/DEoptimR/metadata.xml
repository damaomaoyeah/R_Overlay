		Differential Evolution Optimization in Pure R // Differential
		Evolution (DE) stochastic algorithms for global optimization of
		problems with and without constraints. The aim is to curate a
		collection of its state-of-the-art variants that (1) do not
		sacrifice simplicity of design, (2) are essentially tuning-
		free, and (3) can be efficiently implemented directly in the R
		language. Currently, it only provides an implementation of the
		'jDE' algorithm by Brest et al. (2006)
