		Template Model Builder: A General Random Effect Tool Inspired by
		'ADMB' // With this tool, a user should be able to quickly
		implement complex random effect models through simple C++
		templates. The package combines 'CppAD' (C++ automatic
		differentiation), 'Eigen' (templated matrix-vector library) and
		'CHOLMOD' (sparse matrix routines available from R) to obtain
		an efficient implementation of the applied Laplace
		approximation with exact derivatives. Key features are:
		Automatic sparseness detection, parallelism through 'BLAS' and
		parallel user templates.
