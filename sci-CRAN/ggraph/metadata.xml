		An Implementation of Grammar of Graphics for Graphs and Networks
		// The grammar of graphics as implemented in ggplot2 is a poor
		fit for graph and network visualizations due to its reliance on
		tabular data input. ggraph is an extension of the ggplot2 API
		tailored to graph visualizations and provides the same flexible
		approach to building up plots layer by layer.
