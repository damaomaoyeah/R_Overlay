		Rho for Inter Rater Reliability // Rho is used to test the
		generalization of inter rater reliability (IRR) statistics.
		Calculating rho starts by generating a large number of
		simulated, fully-coded data sets: a sizable collection of
		hypothetical populations, all of which have a kappa value below
		a given threshold -- which indicates unacceptable agreement.
		Then kappa is calculated on a sample from each of those sets in
		the collection to see if it is equal to or higher than the
		kappa in then real sample. If less than five percent of the
		distribution of samples from the simulated data sets is greater
		than actual observed kappa, the null hypothesis is rejected and
		one can conclude that if the two raters had coded the rest of
		the data, we would have acceptable agreement (kappa above the
		threshold).
