		Simple Peak Alignment for Gas-Chromatography Data // Aligns
		chromatography peaks with a three step algorithm: (1) Linear
		transformation of retention times to maximise shared peaks
		among samples (2) Align peaks within a certain error-interval
		(3) Merges rows that are likely representing the same substance
		(i.e. no sample shows peaks in both rows and the rows have
		similar retention time means). The method was first described
		in Stoffel et al. (2015) doi:10.1073/pnas.1506076112.
