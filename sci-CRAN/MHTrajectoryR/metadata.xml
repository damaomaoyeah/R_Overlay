		Bayesian Model Selection in Logistic Regression for the Detection
		of Adverse Drug Reactions // Spontaneous adverse event reports
		have a high potential for detecting adverse drug reactions.
		However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases
		requires statistical methods. We propose to use a logistic
		regression whose sparsity is viewed as a model selection
		challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings
		algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC
		criterion.
