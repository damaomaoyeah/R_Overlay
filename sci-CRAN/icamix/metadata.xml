		Estimation of ICA Mixture Models // The icamix package provides R
		functions as well as a C++ library which facilitate the
		estimation of ICA mixture models. We have developed and
		implemented the NSMM-ICA algorithm that currently integrates
		npEM and Fast-ICA for non-parametric estimation of ICA mixture
		models. We will continue to build in algorithms that interweave
		the EM step with other types of ICA techniques.
