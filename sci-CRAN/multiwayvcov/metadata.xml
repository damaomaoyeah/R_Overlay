		Multi-way Standard Error Clustering // Exports two functions
		implementing multi-way clustering using the method suggested by
		Cameron, Gelbach,  Miller (2011) and cluster (or block)
		bootstrapping for estimating variance-covariance matrices.
		Normal one and two-way clustering matches the results of other
		common statistical packages.  Missing values are handled
		transparently and rudimentary parallelization support is
		provided.
