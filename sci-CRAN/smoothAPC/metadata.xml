		Smoothing of Two-Dimensional Demographic Data, Optionally Taking
		into Account Period and Cohort Effects // The implemented
		method uses for smoothing bivariate thin plate splines,
		bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period
		and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as
		the sum of four components: a smooth bivariate function of age
		and time, smooth one-dimensional cohort effects, smooth one-
		dimensional period effects and random errors.
