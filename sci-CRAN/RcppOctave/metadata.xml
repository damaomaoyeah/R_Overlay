		Seamless Interface to Octave -- and Matlab // Direct interface to
		Octave. The primary goal is to facilitate the port of
		Matlab/Octave scripts to R. The package enables to call any
		Octave functions from R and as well as browsing their
		documentation, passing variables between R and Octave, using R
		core RNGs in Octave, which ensures that stochastic computations
		are also reproducible.
