		Mixtures-of-Experts Markov Chain Clustering and Dirichlet
		Multinomial Clustering // This package provides various Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler for model-based clustering of
		discrete-valued time series obtained by observing a categorical
		variable with several states (in a Bayesian approach).  In
		order to analyze group membership, we provide also an extension
		to the approaches by formulating a probabilistic model for the
		latent group indicators within the Bayesian classification rule
		using a multinomial logit model.
