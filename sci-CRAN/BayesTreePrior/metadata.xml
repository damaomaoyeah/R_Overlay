		Bayesian Tree Prior Simulation // Provides a way to simulate from
		the prior distribution of Bayesian trees by Chipman et al.
		(1998) DOI:10.2307/2669832. The prior distribution of Bayesian
		trees is highly dependent on the design matrix X, therefore
		using the suggested hyperparameters by Chipman et al. (1998)
		DOI:10.2307/2669832 is not recommended and could lead to
		unexpected prior distribution. This work is part of my master
		thesis (In revision, expected 2016) and a journal publication
		I'm working on.
