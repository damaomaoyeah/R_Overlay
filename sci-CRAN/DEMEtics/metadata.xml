		Evaluating the genetic differentiation between populations based
		on Gst and D values. // This package allows to calculate the
		fixation index Gst (Nei, 1973) and the differentiation index D
		(Jost, 2008) pairwise between or averaged over several
		populations.  P-values, stating the significance of
		differentiation, and 95 percent confidence intervals can be
		estimated using bootstrap resamplings. In the case that more
		than two populations are compared pairwise, the p-values are
		adjusted by bonferroni correction and in several other ways due
		to the multiple comparison from one data set.
