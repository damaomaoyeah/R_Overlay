		Coefficient of Determination // Calculates a newly defined
		coefficient of determination, aka R^2, and coefficient of
		partial determination, aka partial R^2 by Zhang (2016) for
		generalized linear models (including quasi models with well
		defined variance functions). It also avoids overstatement of
		variation proportion explained by the model or a group of
		covariates.
