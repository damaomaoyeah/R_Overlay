		Analysis of Illumina BeadArray SNP data including MSV markers //
		Imports bead-summary data from Illumina scanner. Pre-processes
		using a suite of optional normalizations and transformations.
		Clusters and automatically calls genotypes, critically able to
		handle markers in duplicated regions of the genome (multisite
		variants; MSVs). Interactive clustering if needed. MSVs with
		variation in both paralogs may be resolved and mapped to their
		respective chromosomes. Quality control including pedigree
		checking and visual assessment of clusters. Too large data-sets
		are handled by working on smaller subsets of the data in
		sequence.
