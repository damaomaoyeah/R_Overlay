		Variable Selection using Random Forests // Variable selection
		from random forests using both backwards variable elimination
		(for the selection of small sets of non-redundant variables)
		and selection based on the importance spectrum (somewhat
		similar to scree plots; for the selection of large, potentially
		highly-correlated variables). Main applications in high-
		dimensional data (e.g., microarray data, and other genomics and
		proteomics applications).
