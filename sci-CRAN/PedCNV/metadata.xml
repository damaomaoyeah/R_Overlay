		An implementation for association analysis with CNV data. // An
		implementation for association analysis with CNV data in R. It
		provides two methods for association study: first, the observed
		probe intensity measurement can be directly used to detect the
		association of CNV with phenotypes of interest. Second, the
		most probable copy number is estimated with the proposed
		likelihood and the association of the most probable copy number
		with phenotype is tested. This method can be applied to both
		the independent and correlated population.
