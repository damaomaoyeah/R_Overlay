		Another Object Orientation System // Another implementation of
		object-orientation in R. It provides an interface to S4
		reference classes and two alternative new implementations. One
		is an experimental version built around S4 (defineClass) and
		the other one (retList) makes it more convenient to work with
		lists returned from functions and uses only S3.
