		Preferential Attachment Based Common Neighbor Distribution
		Derived Functional Associations // PANDA (Preferential
		Attachment based common Neighbor Distribution derived
		Associations) is designed to perform the following tasks in PPI
		networks: (1) identify significantly functionally associated
		protein pairs, (2) predict GO terms and KEGG pathways for
		proteins, (3) make a cluster of proteins based on the
		significant protein pairs, (4) identify subclusters whose
		members are enriched in KEGG pathways. For other types of
		biological networks, (1) and (3) can still be performed.
