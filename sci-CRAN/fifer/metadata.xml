		A Biostatisticians Toolbox for Various Activities, Including
		Plotting, Data Cleanup, and Data Analysis // Functions and
		datasets that can be used for data cleanup (e.g., functions for
		eliminating all but a few columns from a dataset, selecting a
		range of columns, quickly editing column names),
		plotting/presenting data (prism-like reproductions, spearman
		plots for ordinal data, making colored tables, plotting
		interactions with quantitative variables), and analyses common
		to biostatistics (e.g., random forest, multiple comparisons
		with chi square tests). See the package vignette for a brief
		introduction to many of the main functions.
