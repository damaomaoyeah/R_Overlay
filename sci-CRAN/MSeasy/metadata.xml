		Preprocessing of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)
		data // Package for the detection of molecules in complex
		mixtures of compounds. It creates an initial_DATA matrix from
		several GC-MS analyses by collecting and assembling the
		information from chromatograms and mass spectra
		(MS.DataCreation), It can read several format (ASCII, CDF,
		mzML, mzXML or mzData).It tests for the best unsupervised
		clustering method to group similar mass spectra into molecules
		(MS.test.clust).It runs the optimal unsupervised clustering
		method on the initial_DATA matrix, identifies the optimal
		number of clusters, produces different files for facilitating
		the quality control and identification of putative molecules,
		and returns fingerprinting or profiling matrices (MS.clust).It
		converts output files from MS.clust for NIST mass spectral
		library search and ARISTO webtool search
