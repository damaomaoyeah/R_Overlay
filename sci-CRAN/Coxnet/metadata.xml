		Regularized Cox Model // Cox model regularized with net (L1 and
		Laplacian), elastic-net (L1 and L2) or lasso (L1) penalty. In
		addition, it can truncate the estimate by a hard threshold,
		which is selected simultaneously with other tuning parameters.
		Moreover, it can handle the adaptive version of these
		regularization forms, such as adaptive lasso and net adjusting
		for signs of linked coefficients. The package uses one-step
		coordinate descent algorithm and runs extremely fast by taking
		into account the sparsity structure of coefficients.
