		Regularized Cox Model // Cox model regularized with net (L1 and
		Laplacian), elastic-net (L1 and L2) or lasso (L1) penalty, and
		their adaptive forms, such as adaptive lasso and net adjusting
		for signs of linked coefficients. Moreover, it treats the
		number of non-zero coefficients as another tuning parameter and
		simultaneously selects with the regularization parameter
		\code{lambda}. In addition, it fits a varying coefficient Cox
		model by kernel smoothing, incorporated with the aforementioned
		penalties. The package uses one-step coordinate descent
		algorithm and runs extremely fast by taking into account the
		sparsity structure of coefficients.
