		Create and Navigate Large Multi-Panel Visual Displays // An
		extension of Trellis Display that enables creation,
		organization, and interactive viewing of multi-panel displays
		created against potentially very large data sets.  The dynamic
		viewer tiles panels of a display across the screen in a web
		browser and allows the user to interactively page through the
		panels and sort and filter them based on "cognostic" metrics
		computed for each panel.  Panels can be created using many of
		R's plotting capabilities, including base R graphics,
		'lattice', 'ggplot2', and many 'htmlwidgets'.  Conditioning is
		handled through the 'datadr' package, which enables
		'Trelliscope' displays with potentially millions of panels to
		be created against terabytes of data on systems like 'Hadoop'.
		While designed to scale, 'Trelliscope' displays can also be
		very useful for small data sets.
