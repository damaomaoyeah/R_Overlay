		Product Plots for R // Framework for visualising tables of
		counts, proportions and probabilities. The framework is called
		product plots, alluding to the computation of area as a product
		of height and width, and the statistical concept of generating
		a joint distribution from the product of conditional and
		marginal distributions. The framework, with extensions, is
		sufficient to encompass over 20 visualisations previously
		described in fields of statistical graphics and 'infovis',
		including bar charts, mosaic plots, 'treemaps', equal area
		plots and fluctuation diagrams.
