		Implementation of the Nemenyi post-hoc test to find the groups of
		data that differ after a statistical test of multiple
		comparisons, e.g. Friedman test. Reference: Japkowicz/Shah
		(2011), Evaluating Learning Algorithms. Pages 255 ff. // Takes
		a matrix with samples (rows) for multiple groups (columns).
		Calculates Friedman-like ranks of the groups per row. Sums the
		ranks of each group over all samples. Calculates the pairwise
		difference between the summed ranks, representing the Nemenyi-
		value. Looks up the corresponding p-value from the studentized
		range (q)-distribution.
