		Inference on Single Binomial Proportion and Bayesian Computations
		// Abundant statistical literature has revealed the importance
		of constructing and evaluating various methods for constructing
		confidence intervals (CI) for single binomial proportion (p).
		We comprehensively provide procedures in frequentist
		(approximate with or without adding pseudo counts or continuity
		correction or exact) and in Bayesian cultures. Evaluation
		procedures for CI warrant active computational attention and
		required summaries pertaining to  four criterion (coverage
		probability, expected length, p-confidence, p-bias, and error)
		are implemented.
