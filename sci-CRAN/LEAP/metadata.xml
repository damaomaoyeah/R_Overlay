		Constructing Gene Co-Expression Networks for Single-Cell RNA-
		Sequencing Data Using Pseudotime Ordering // Advances in
		sequencing technology now allow researchers to capture the
		expression profiles of individual cells. Several algorithms
		have been developed to attempt to account for these effects by
		determining a cell's so-called `pseudotime', or relative
		biological state of transition. By applying these algorithms to
		single-cell sequencing data, we can sort cells into their
		pseudotemporal ordering based on gene expression. LEAP (Lag-
		based Expression Association for Pseudotime-series) then
		applies a time-series inspired lag-based correlation analysis
		to reveal linearly dependent genetic associations.
