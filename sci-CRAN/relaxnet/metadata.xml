		Relaxation of glmnet models (as in relaxed lasso, Meinshausen
		2007) // Extends the glmnet package with "relaxation", done by
		running glmnet once on the entire predictor matrix, then again
		on each different subset of variables from along the
		regularization path. Relaxation may lead to improved prediction
		accuracy for truly sparse data generating models, as well as
		fewer false positives (i.e. fewer noncontributing predictors in
		the final model). Penalty may be lasso (alpha = 1) or elastic
		net (0  alpha  1). For this version, family may be "gaussian"
		or "binomial" only. Takes advantage of fast FORTRAN code from
		the glmnet package.
