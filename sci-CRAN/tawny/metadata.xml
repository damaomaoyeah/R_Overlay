		Clean Covariance Matrices Using Random Matrix Theory and
		Shrinkage Estimators for Portfolio Optimization // Portfolio
		optimization typically requires an estimate of a covariance
		matrix of asset returns. There are many approaches for
		constructing such a covariance matrix, some using the sample
		covariance matrix as a starting point. This package provides
		implementations for two such methods: random matrix theory and
		shrinkage estimation. Each method attempts to clean or remove
		noise related to the sampling process from the sample
		covariance matrix.
