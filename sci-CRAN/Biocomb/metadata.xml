		Feature Selection and Classification with the Embedded Validation
		Procedures for Biomedical Data Analysis // Contains functions
		for the data analysis with the emphasis on biological data,
		including several algorithms for feature ranking, feature
		selection, classification algorithms with the embedded
		validation procedures. The functions can deal with numerical as
		well as with nominal features. Includes also the functions for
		calculation of feature AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) and HUM
		(hypervolume under manifold) values and construction 2D- and
		3D- ROC curves. Biocomb provides the calculation of Area Above
		the RCC (AAC) values and construction of Relative Cost Curves
		(RCC) to estimate the classifier performance under unequal
		misclassification costs problem. Biocomb has the special
		function to deal with missing values, including different
		imputing schemes.
