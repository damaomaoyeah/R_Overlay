		Stratified Analysis with Nonparametric covariable adjustment //
		This package has several functions to implement the method for
		analysis in a randomized clinical trial with strata with
		following key features. A stratified Mann-Whitney estimator
		addresses the comparison between two randomized groups for a
		strictly ordinal response variable. The multivariate vector of
		such stratified Mann-Whitney estimators for multivariate
		response variables can be considered for one or more response
		variables such as in repeated measurements and these can have
		missing completely at random (MCAR) data. Non-parametric
		covariance adjustment is also considered with the minimal
		assumption of randomization. The p-value for hypothesis test
		and confidence interval are provided.
