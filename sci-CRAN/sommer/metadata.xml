		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Mixed model equation solver
		allowing the specification of variance covariance structures
		for random effects. ML/REML estimates are obtained using the
		Average Information, Expectation-Maximization, Newton-Raphson,
		or Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithms. Designed for
		genomic prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS)
		to include additive, dominance and epistatic relationship
		structures or other covariance structures in R, but also
		functional as a regular mixed model program.
