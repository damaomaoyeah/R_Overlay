		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Mixed model equation solver
		allowing the specification of variance covariance structures of
		random effects and residual structures. ML/REML estimates are
		obtained using the Average Information and/or Expectation-
		Maximization algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction and
		genome wide association studies (GWAS) to include additive,
		dominant and epistatic relationship structures or other
		covariance structures in R.
