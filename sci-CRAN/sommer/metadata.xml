		Solving Mixed Model Equations in R // Multivariate mixed model
		solver for multiple random effects allowing the specification
		of variance covariance structures. ML/REML estimates are
		obtained using the Average Information (AI), Expectation-
		Maximization (EM), Newton-Raphson (NR), or Efficient Mixed
		Model Association (EMMA) algorithms. Designed for genomic
		prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS) to
		include additive, dominance and epistatic relationship
		structures or other covariance structures in R, but also
		functional as a regular mixed model program. Multivariate
		models (multiple responses) can be fitted currently with NR, AI
		and EMMA algorithms allowing multiple random effects as well.
		Covariance structures for the residual component is currently
		supported only for balanced univariate Newton Raphson.
