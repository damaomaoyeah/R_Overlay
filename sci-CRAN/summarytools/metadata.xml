		Dataframe Summaries, Frequency Tables and Numerical Summaries
		with Customizable Output // Generates formatted summary tables
		for vectors and dataframes. Three summarizing functions: 1)
		'freq' generates frequency tables reporting counts and
		proportions (including cumulative); 2) 'descr' gives common
		central tendency statistics and measures of dispersion for
		numerical data; 3) 'dfSummary' gives as much information as
		possible about a dataframe and its components in a clear,
		legible table. All three functions can either display plain
		text tables in the console or write markdown, text or html
		files to disk. An additional misc function, 'what.is', extends
		base 'is' function, checking the object against all 'is'
		functions and gives a variety of other information about the
		object.
