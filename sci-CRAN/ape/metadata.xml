		Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution // Functions for reading,
		writing, plotting, and manipulating phylogenetic trees,
		analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic framework,
		ancestral character analyses, analyses of diversification and
		macroevolution, computing distances from DNA sequences, reading
		and writing nucleotide sequences as well as importing from
		BioConductor, and several tools such as Mantel's test,
		generalized skyline plots, graphical exploration of
		phylogenetic data (alex, trex, kronoviz), estimation of
		absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like trees using mean
		path lengths and penalized likelihood, dating trees with non-
		contemporaneous sequences, translating DNA into AA sequences,
		and assessing sequence alignments. Phylogeny estimation can be
		done with the NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods,
		and several methods handling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*,
		BIONJ*, MVR*, and the corresponding triangle method). Some
		functions call external applications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee,
		Muscle, MAFFT) whose results are returned into R.
