		Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution // Functions for reading,
		writing, plotting, and manipulating phylogenetic trees,
		analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic framework,
		ancestral character analyses, analyses of diversification and
		macroevolution, computing distances from allelic and nucleotide
		data, reading and writing nucleotide sequences as well as
		importing from BioConductor, and several tools such as Mantel's
		test, generalized skyline plots, graphical exploration of
		phylogenetic data (alex, trex, kronoviz), estimation of
		absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like trees using mean
		path lengths and penalized likelihood. Phylogeny estimation can
		be done with the NJ, BIONJ, ME, MVR, SDM, and triangle methods,
		and several methods handling incomplete distance matrices (NJ*,
		BIONJ*, MVR*, and the corresponding triangle method). Some
		functions call external applications (PhyML, Clustal, T-Coffee,
		Muscle) whose results are returned into R.
