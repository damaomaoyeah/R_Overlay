		Manage and manipulate large collections of R objects stored as
		tape-like files // Storing huge data in RData format causes
		problems because of the necessity to load the whole file to the
		memory in order to access and manipulate objects inside such
		file; rtape is a simple solution to this problem. The package
		contains several wrappers of R built-in serialize/unserialize
		mechanism allowing user to quickly append objects to a tape-
		like file and later iterate over them requiring only one copy
		of each stored object to reside in memory a time.
