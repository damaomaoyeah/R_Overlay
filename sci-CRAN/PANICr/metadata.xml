		PANIC Tests of Nonstationarity // This package contains a
		methodology that makes use of the factor structure of large
		dimensional panels to understand the nature of nonstationarity
		inherent in data. This is referred to as PANIC - Panel Analysis
		of Nonstationarity in Idiosyncratic and Common Components.
		PANIC (2004) includes valid pooling methods that allow panel
		unit root tests tests to be constructed. PANIC (2004) can
		detect whether the nonstationarity in a series is pervasive, or
		variable specific, or both. PANIC (2010) includes the Panel
		Modified Sargan-Bhargava test, three models for a Moon and
		Perron style test, and a bias correction for the idiosyncratic
		unit root test of PANIC (2004). The PANIC model approximates
		the number of factors based on Bai and Ng (2002).
