		PANIC Tests of Nonstationarity // A methodology that makes use of
		the factor structure of large dimensional panels to understand
		the nature of nonstationarity inherent in data. This is
		referred to as PANIC, Panel Analysis of Nonstationarity in
		Idiosyncratic and Common Components. PANIC
		(2004)doi:10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00528.x includes valid
		pooling methods that allow panel tests to be constructed. PANIC
		(2004) can detect whether the nonstationarity in a series is
		pervasive, or variable specific, or both. PANIC (2010)
		doi:10.1017/s0266466609990478 includes two new tests on the
		idiosyncratic component that estimates the pooled
		autoregressive coefficient and sample moment, respectively. The
		PANIC model approximates the number of factors based on Bai and
		Ng (2002) doi:10.1111/1468-0262.00273.
