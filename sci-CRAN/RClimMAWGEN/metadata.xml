		RClimMAWGEN (R Climate Index Multi-site Auto-regressive Weather
		GENeretor): a package to generate time series of climate
		indices from RMAWGEN generations. // This package contains
		wrapper functions and methods which allow to use "climdex.pcic"
		and "RMAWGEN" packages.  With this simple approach it is
		possible to calculate climate change indices, suggested by the
		WMO-CCL, CLIVAR, ETCCDMI(http://www.climdex.org),on stochastic
		generations of temperature and precipitation time series,
		obtained by the application of RMAWGEN.  Each index can be
		applied to both observed data and to synthetic time series
		produced by the Weather Generator, over a reference period
		(e.g. 1981-2010, as in the example). It contains also functions
		and methods to evaluate the generated time series of climate
		change indices consistency by statistical
		tests.Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are
		warmly welcomed.
