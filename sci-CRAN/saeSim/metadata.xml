		Simulation Tools for Small Area Estimation // Tools for the
		simulation of data in the context of small area estimation.
		Combine all steps of your simulation - from data generation
		over drawing samples to model fitting - in one object. This
		enables easy modification and combination of different
		scenarios. You can store your results in a folder or start the
		simulation in parallel.
