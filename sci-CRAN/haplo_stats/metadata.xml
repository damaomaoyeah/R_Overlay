		Statistical Analysis of Haplotypes with Traits and Covariates
		when Linkage Phase is Ambiguous // Routines for the analysis of
		indirectly measured haplotypes. The statistical methods assume
		that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are
		ambiguous (due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic
		markers). The main functions are: haplo.em(), haplo.glm(),
		haplo.score(), and haplo.power(); all of which have detailed
		examples in the vignette.
