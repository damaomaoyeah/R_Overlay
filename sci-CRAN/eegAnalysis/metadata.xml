		(EEG) data. // Package with tools for classification of
		electroencephalography (EEG) data. Feature extraction
		techniques such as Fourier Transform and Continuous Wavelet
		Transform (CWT) are available. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
		can be used to classify the extracted features. An algorithm
		using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), False Discovery Rate (FDR),
		and SVM is available to feature selection. Additionally, the
