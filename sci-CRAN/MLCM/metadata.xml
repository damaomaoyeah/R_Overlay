		Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement // Conjoint measurement
		is a psychophysical procedure in which stimulus pairs are
		presented that vary along 2 or more dimensions and the observer
		is required to compare the stimuli along one of them.  This
		package contains functions to estimate the contribution of the
		n scales to the judgment by a maximum likelihood method under
		several hypotheses of how the perceptual dimensions interact.
