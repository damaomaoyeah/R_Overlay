		Visualizes the scoring and binning of microsatellite fragment
		sizes // The package contains functions to: 1) load ah files
		from Strand software and build a R data base; 2) plot different
		graphical displays of the fragment sizes obtained for each
		locus and their bins; 3) interact with graphs to sort the data
		base for a given locus and range, allowing to easily  trace
		back a particular group of samples to its original Strand file;
		bin fragment size data into population genetics files. 4) From
		version 1.04 on, the user can set manually bin limits and write
		files combining the manual and automatic methods to bin
		alleles.
