		Gini methodology-based correlation and clustering analysis of
		microarray and RNA-Seq gene expression data // This package
		provides functions for calculating associations between two
		genes with five correlation methods(e.g., the Gini correlation
		coefficient [GCC], the Pearson's product moment correlation
		coefficient [PCC], the Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient
		[KCC], the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [SCC] and
		the Tukey's biweight correlation coefficient [BiWt], and three
		non-correlation methods (e.g., mutual information [MI] and the
		maximal information-based nonparametric exploration [MINE], and
		the euclidean distance [ED]). It can also been implemented to
		perform the correlation and clustering analysis of
		transcriptomic data profiled by microarray and RNA-Seq
		technologies. Additionally, this package can be further applied
		to construct gene co-expression networks (GCNs).
