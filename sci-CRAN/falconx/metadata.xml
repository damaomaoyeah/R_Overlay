		Finding Allele-Specific Copy Number in Whole-Exome Sequencing
		Data // This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number
		profiling for whole-Exome sequencing data.  Given the allele-
		specific coverage and site biases at the variant loci, this
		program segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-
		specific copy number.  It requires, as input, the read counts
		for each variant allele in a pair of case and control samples,
		as well as the site biases. For detection of somatic mutations,
		the case and control samples can be the tumor and normal sample
		from the same individual.  The implemented method is based on
		the paper: Chen, H., Jiang, Y., Maxwell, K., Nathanson, K. and
		Zhang, N. (under review). Allele-specific copy number
		estimation by whole Exome sequencing.
