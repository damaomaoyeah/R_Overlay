		R Package for Geometric Shade Calculations // Functions for
		calculating (1) shade height at a single point, (2) shaded
		proportion of a building facade; (3) a polygonal layer of shade
		footprints on the ground; and (4) Sky View Factor value at a
		single point. Typical inputs include a polygonal layer of
		buildings outline along with the height of each building, sun
		azimuth and sun elevation. The package also provides functions
		for related preliminary calculations: converting polygons to
		line segments, finding segment azimuth, shifting segments by
		azimuth and distance, and constructing the footprint of a line
		of sight between an observer and the sun.
