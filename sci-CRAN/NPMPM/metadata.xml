		tertiary probabilistic model in predictive microbiology for use
		in food manufacture // The main method npmpm calculates
		bacterial concentrations during food manufacture after a
		contamination. Variability and uncertainty are included by use
		of probability distributions and Monte Carlo Simulation. The
		model aims at predicting possible bacterial concentrations at
		one certain point in time s, e.g. at the end of a process
		chain. The process steps of this process chain are run through
		in linear order. Experimental data that match current process
		step conditions are gathered, and one deterministic primary
		model is fitted to every series of measured values. From every
		fitted curve one concentration of bacteria at time s is
		computed, yielding a set of concentrations. This sample of
		possible contamination sizes is assumed to follow a certain
		probability distribution. After calculation of distribution
		parameters, one value is randomly drawn from this probability
		distribution. This value may be modified, and then serves as
		contamination for the next process step.
