		Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering Using Spike and Slab Models //
		Builds a dendrogram using log posterior as a natural distance
		defined by the model and meanwhile waits the clustering
		variables. It is also capable to computing equivalent Bayesian
		discrimination probabilities. The adopted method suites small
		sample large dimension setting. The model parameter estimation
		maybe difficult, depending on data structure and the chosen
		distribution family.
