		Statistical Package for Reliability Data Analysis // The
		Statistical Package for REliability Data Analysis (SPREDA)
		implements recently-developed statistical methods for the
		analysis of reliability data. Modern technological
		developments, such as sensors and smart chips, allow us to
		dynamically track product/system usage as well as other
		environmental variables, such as temperature and humidity. We
		refer to these variables as dynamic covariates. The package
		contains functions for the analysis of time-to-event data with
		dynamic covariates and degradation data with dynamic
		covariates. The package also contains functions that can be
		used for analyzing time-to-event data with right censoring, and
		with left truncation and right censoring. Financial support
		from NSF and DuPont are acknowledged.
