		Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals for (Negative) Likelihood Ratio
		Tests // Computes appropriate confidence intervals for the
		likelihood ratio tests commonly used in medicine/epidemiology.
		It is particularly useful when the sensitivity or specificity
		in the sample is 100%.  Note that this does not perform the
		test on nested models--for that, see 'epicalc::lrtest'.
