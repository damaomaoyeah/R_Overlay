		Bootstrapped confidence intervals for (negative) likelihood ratio
		tests // This package computes appropriate confidence intervals
		for the likelihood ratio tests commonly used in
		medicine/epidemiology.  It is particularly useful when the
		sensitivity or specificy in the sample is 100%.  Note that this
		does not perform the test on nested models--for that, see
		epicalc::lrtest.
