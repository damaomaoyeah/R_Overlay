		US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) Vaccine Data
		for Present // US VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2016 -
		06/14/2016. If you want to explore the full VAERS data for 1990
		- Present (data, symptoms, and vaccines), then check out the
		'vaers' package from the URL below. The URL and BugReports
		below correspond to the 'vaers' package, of which 'vaersvax' is
		a small subset (2016 only). 'vaers' is not hosted on CRAN due
		to the large size of the data set. To install the Suggested
		'vaers' and 'vaersND' packages, use the following R code:
		'devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaers.git",
		build_vignettes = TRUE)' and
		'devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaersND.git",
		build_vignettes = TRUE)'. "VAERS is a national vaccine safety
		surveillance program co-sponsored by the US Centers for Disease
		Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug
		Administration (FDA). VAERS is a post-marketing safety
		surveillance program, collecting information about adverse
		events (possible side effects) that occur after the
		administration of vaccines licensed for use in the United
		States." For more information about the data, visit
