		Shape-Preserving Uni-Variate and Bi-Variate Spline Interpolation
		// Program uses method of polynomial of variable degrees to
		interpolate gridded data preserving monotonicity and/or
		convexity or none. Method is implemented for univariate and
		bivariate cases. If values of derivatives are provided, spline
		will fix them,if not program will estimate them numerically.
		Package written purely in R.
