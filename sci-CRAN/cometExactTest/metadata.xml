		Exact Test from the Combinations of Mutually Exclusive
		Alterations (CoMEt) Algorithm // An algorithm for identifying
		combinations of mutually exclusive alterations in cancer
		genomes. CoMEt represents the mutations in a set M of k genes
		with a 2^k dimensional contingency table, and then computes the
		tail probability of observing T(M) exclusive alterations using
		an exact statistical test.
