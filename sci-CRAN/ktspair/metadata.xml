		k-Top Scoring Pairs for Microarray Classification // These
		functions compute the k best pairs of genes used to classify
		samples based on the relative rank of the genes expression
		within each profile. A score based on the sensitivity and the
		specificity is calculated for every possible pair. The k pairs
		with the highest score will be selected with the restriction
		that a gene can appear in at most one pair. The value of k is
		either set as a parameter chosen by the user or computed
		through crossvalidation. Other functions related to the k-TSP
		are also available, for example the functions prediction,
		summary, plot, etc. can be found in the package.
