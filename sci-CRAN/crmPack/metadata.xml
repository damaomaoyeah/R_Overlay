		Object-Oriented Implementation of CRM Designs // Implements a
		wide range of model-based dose escalation designs, ranging from
		classical and modern continual reassessment methods (CRMs)
		based on dose-limiting toxicity endpoints to dual-endpoint
		designs taking into account a biomarker/efficacy outcome. The
		focus is on Bayesian inference, making it very easy to setup a
		new design with its own JAGS code. However, it is also possible
		to implement 3+3 designs for comparison or models with non-
		Bayesian estimation. The whole package is written in a modular
		form in the S4 class system, making it very flexible for
		adaptation to new models, escalation or stopping rules.
