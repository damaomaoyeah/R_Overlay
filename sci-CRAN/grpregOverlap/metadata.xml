		Penalized Regression Models with Overlapping Grouped Covariates
		// Fit the regularization path of linear, logistic or Cox
		models with overlapping grouped covariates based on the latent
		group lasso approach. Latent group MCP/SCAD as well as bi-level
		selection methods, namely the group exponential lasso and the
		composite MCP are also available. This package serves as an
		extension of R package 'grpreg' (by Dr. Patrick Breheny
		patrick-breheny@uiowa.edu) for grouped variable selection
		involving overlaps between groups.
