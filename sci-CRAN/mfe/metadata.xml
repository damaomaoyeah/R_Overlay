		Meta-Feature Extractor // Extracts meta-features from datasets to
		support the design of recommendation systems based on Meta-
		Learning. The meta-features, also called characterization
		measures, are able to characterize the complexity of datasets
		and to provide estimates of algorithm performance. The package
		contains not only the standard characterization measures, but
		also more recent characterization measures. By making available
		a large set of meta-feature extraction functions, this package
		allows a comprehensive data characterization, a deep data
		exploration and a large number of Meta-Learning based data
		analysis. These concepts are described in the book: Brazdil,
		P., Giraud-Carrier, C., Soares, C., Vilalta, R. (2009)
