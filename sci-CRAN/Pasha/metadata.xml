		Preprocessing of Aligned Sequences from HTS Analyses // Pipeline
		and additional tools designed to handle aligned data from
		chromatin NGS experiments (less adapted for typical RNAseq
		applications). Specifically, starting from aligned reads after
		sequencing, the pipeline function aims at removing artefacts
		from datasets, estimate in-silico the fragments size, and
		generate WIG files with corrected values. The package also
		provides several tools for WIG files manipulations, scaling,
		merging and subtract (e.g. input).
