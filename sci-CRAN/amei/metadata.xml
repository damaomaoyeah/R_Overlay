		Adaptive Management of Epidemiological Interventions // This
		package provides a flexible statistical framework for
		generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are
		designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging
		epidemic while simultaneously propagating uncertainty regarding
		underlying disease parameters through to the decision process
		via Bayesian posterior inference.  The strategies produced
		through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are
		iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of
		the epidemic given the current population state and updated
		parameter estimates.
