		Linear mixed effect model splines for modelling and analysis of
		time course data // The package implements linear mixed effect
		model splines for modelling and differential expression for
		highly dimensional data sets: investNoise for quality control
		and filterNoise for removing non-informative trajectories;
		lmmSpline to model time course expression profiles and lmmsDE
		performs differential expression analysis to identify
		differential expression between groups, time and/or time x
		group interaction.
