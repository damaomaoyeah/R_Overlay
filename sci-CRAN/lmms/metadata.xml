		Linear Mixed Effect Model Splines for Modelling and Analysis of
		Time Course Data // Linear Mixed effect Model Splines ('lmms')
		implements linear mixed effect model splines for modelling and
		differential expression for highly dimensional data sets:
		investNoise() for quality control and filterNoise() for
		removing non-informative trajectories; lmmSpline() to model
		time course expression profiles and lmmsDE() performs
		differential expression analysis to identify differential
		expression between groups, time and/or group x time
		interaction.
