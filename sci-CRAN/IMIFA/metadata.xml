		Fitting, Diagnostics, and Plotting Functions for Infinite
		Mixtures of Infinite Factor Analysers and Related Models //
		Provides flexible Gibbs sampler functions for fitting Infinite
		Mixtures of Infinite Factor Analysers and related models,
		introduced by Murphy et al. (2017)
		https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07010, which conducts Bayesian
		nonparametric model-based clustering with factor analytic
		covariance structures without recourse to model selection
		criteria to choose the number of clusters or cluster-specific
		latent factors. Model-specific diagnostic tools are also
		provided, as well as many options for plotting results and
		conducting posterior inference on parameters of interest.
