		Multi-state Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time //
		Continuous-time Markov and hidden Markov multi-state models for
		longitudinal data.  Designed for processes observed at
		arbitrary times in continuous time (panel data) but some other
		observation schemes are supported. Both Markov transition rates
		and the hidden Markov output process can be modelled in terms
		of covariates, which may be constant or piecewise-constant in
		time.
