		Radiomics Image Analysis Toolbox for Grayscale Images //
		Radiomics image analysis toolbox for grayscale 2D and 3D
		images. RIA calculates first-order, gray level co-occurrence
		matrix, gray level run length matrix and geometry-based
		statistics. Almost all calculations are done using vectorized
		formulas to optimize run speeds. Calculation of several
		thousands of parameters only takes minutes on a single core of
		a conventional PC.
