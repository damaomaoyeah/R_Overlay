		Biplot representations of categorical data // Analysis of a
		matrix of polytomous items using Nominal Logistic Biplots (NLB)
		according to Hernandez-Sanchez and Vicente-Villardon (2013).
		The NLB procedure extends the binary logistic biplot to nominal
		(polytomous) data. The  individuals are represented as points
		on a plane and the  variables are represented as convex
		prediction regions rather than vectors as in a classical or
		binary biplot. Using the methods from Computational Geometry,
		the set of prediction regions is converted to a set of points
		in such a way that the prediction for each individual is
		established by its closest "category point". Then
		interpretation is based on distances rather than on
		projections. In this package we implement the geometry of such
		a representation and construct computational algorithms for the
		estimation of parameters and the calculation of prediction
		regions.
