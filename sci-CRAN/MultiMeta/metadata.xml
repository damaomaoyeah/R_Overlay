		Meta-analysis of Multivariate Genome Wide Association Studies //
		Allows running a meta-analysis of multivariate Genome Wide
		Association Studies (GWAS) and easily visualizing results
		through custom plotting functions. The multivariate setting
		implies that results for each single nucleotide polymorphism
		(SNP) include several effect sizes (also known as "beta
		coefficients", one for each trait), as well as related variance
		values, but also covariance between the betas. The main goal of
		the package is to provide combined beta coefficients across
		different cohorts, together with the combined
		variance/covariance matrix. The method is inverse-variance
		based, thus each beta is weighted by the inverse of its
		variance-covariance matrix, before taking the average across
		all betas. The default options of the main function
		\code{multi_meta} will work with files obtained from GEMMA
		multivariate option for GWAS (Zhou  Stephens, 2014). It will
		work with any other output, as soon as columns are formatted to
		have the according names. The package also provides several
		plotting functions for QQ-plots, Manhattan Plots and custom
		summary plots.
