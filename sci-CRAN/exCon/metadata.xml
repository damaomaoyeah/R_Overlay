		Interactive Exploration of Contour Data // An interactive tool to
		explore topographic-like data sets.  Such data sets take the
		form of a matrix in which the rows and columns provide
		location/frequency information, and the matrix elements contain
		altitude/response information.  Such data is found in
		cartography, 2D spectroscopy and chemometrics.  exCon creates
		an interactive web page showing the contoured data set along
		with slices from the original matrix parallel to each
		dimension. The page is written in d3/javascript.
