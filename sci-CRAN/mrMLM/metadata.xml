		Multi-Locus Random-SNP-Effect Mixed Linear Model for Genome-Wide
		Association Studies and Linkage Analyses // Conduct multi-locus
		GWAS and multi-locus QTL mapping under the framework of random-
		SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each position (or
		marker) on the genome is scanned by mrMLM algorithm. Bonferroni
		correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion
		for significant test. Then, all the markers (or QTL) that are
		potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-
		locus model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes and
		true QTN or QTL are identified by likelihood ratio test.
