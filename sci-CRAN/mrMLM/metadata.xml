		Multilocus Random Mixed Linear Model for Genome-Wide Association
		Study // Conduct multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear
		model analysis for genome-wide association study. First, each
		marker is scanned using random-SNP-effect mixed linear model
		method. Then, all the markers selected from the first step are
		included in the multi-locus model and their effects are
		estimated by an EM empirical Bayes method. No multiple test
		correction is needed.
