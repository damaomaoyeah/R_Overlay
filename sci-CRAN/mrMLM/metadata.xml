		Multilocus Random Mixed Linear Model for Genome-Wide Association
		Study and Linkage Analysis // Conduct multi-locus random-SNP-
		effect mixed linear model analysis for genome-wide association
		study and linkage analysis. First, each position (or marker) on
		the genome is scanned using random-SNP-effect mixed linear
		model method. Then, all the markers (or putative QTL) selected
		from the first step are included in the multi-locus model and
		their effects are estimated by an EM empirical Bayes method.
		Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection
		criterion for significance test.
