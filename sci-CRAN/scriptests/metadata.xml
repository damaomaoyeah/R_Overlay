		Transcript-Based Unit Tests that are Easy to Create and Maintain
		// Support for using .Rt (transcript) tests in the tests
		directory of a package.  Provides more convenience and features
		than the standard .R/.Rout.save tests.  Tests can be run under
		R CMD check and also interactively.  Provides source.pkg() for
		quickly loading code, DLLs, and data from a package for use in
		an edit/compile/test development cycle.
