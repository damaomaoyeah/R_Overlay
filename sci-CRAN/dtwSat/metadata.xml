		Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping for Remote Sensing Time Series
		Analysis // Provides a Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping
		(TWDTW) algorithm to measure similarity between two temporal
		sequences. This adaptation of the classical Dynamic Time
		Warping (DTW) algorithm is flexible to compare events that have
		a strong time dependency, such as phenological stages of
		cropland systems and tropical forests. This package provides
		methods for visualization of minimum cost paths, time series
		alignment, and time intervals classification.
