		Inversion of Laplace-Transformed Functions // Provides two
		functions for the numerical inversion of Laplace-Transformed
		functions, returning the value of the standard (time) domain
		function at a specified value.  The first algorithm is the
		first optimum contour algorithm described by Evans and Chung
		(2000)[1]. The second algorithm uses the Bromwich contour as
		per the definition of the inverse Laplace Transform.  The
		latter is unstable for numerical inversion and mainly included
		for comparison or interest.  There are also some additional
		functions provided for utility, including plotting and some
		simple Laplace Transform examples, for which there are known
		analytical solutions.  Polar-cartesian conversion functions are
		included in this package and are used by the inversion
		functions. [1] Evans  Chung, 2000: Laplace transform inversions
		using optimal contours in the complex plane; International
		Journal of Computer Mathematics v73 pp531-543.
