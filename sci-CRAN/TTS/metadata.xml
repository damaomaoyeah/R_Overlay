		Master Curve Estimates Corresponding to Time-Temperature
		Superposition // Time-Temperature Superposition analysis is
		often applied to frequency modulated data obtained by Dynamic
		Mechanic Analysis (DMA) and Rheometry in the analytical
		chemistry and physics areas. These techniques provide estimates
		of material mechanical properties (such as moduli) at different
		temperatures in a wider range of time. This package provides
		the Time-Temperature superposition Master Curve at a referred
		temperature by the three methods: the two wider used methods,
		Arrhenius based methods and WLF, and the newer methodology
		based on derivatives procedure. The Master Curve is smoothed by
		B-splines basis. The package output is composed of plots of
		experimental data, horizontal and vertical shifts, TTS data,
		and TTS data fitted using B-splines with bootstrap confidence
		intervals.
