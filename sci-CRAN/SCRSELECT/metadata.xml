		Performs Bayesian Variable Selection on the Covariates in a Semi-
		Competing Risks Model // Contains four functions used in the
		DIC-tau_g procedure. SCRSELECT() and SCRSELECTRUN() uses
		Stochastic Search Variable Selection to select important
		covariates in the three hazard functions of a semi-competing
		risks model. These functions perform the Gibbs sampler for
		variable selection and a Metropolis-Hastings-Green sampler for
		the number of split points and parameters for the three
		baseline hazard function. The function SCRSELECT() returns the
		posterior sample of all quantities sampled in the Gibbs sampler
		after a burn-in period to a desired file location, while the
		function SCRSELECTRUN() returns posterior values of important
		quantities to the DIC-Tau_g procedure in a list. The function
		DICTAUG() returns a list containing the DIC values for the
		unique models visited by the DIC-Tau_g grid search. The
		function ReturnModel() uses SCRSELECTRUN() and DICTAUG() to
		return a summary of the posterior coefficient vectors for the
		optimal model along with saving this posterior sample to a
		desired path location.
