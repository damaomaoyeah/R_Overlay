		Causal Inference in the Presence of Treatment Noncompliance Under
		the Binary Instrumental Variable Model // A finite-population
		significance test of the 'sharp' causal null hypothesis that
		treatment exposure X has no effect on final outcome Y, within
		the principal stratum of Compliers. A generalized likelihood
		ratio test statistic is used, and the resulting p-value is
		exact. Currently, it is assumed that there are only Compliers
		and Never Takers in the population.
