		Regularized Model with Selecting the Number of Non-Zeros // Fit
		linear and cox models regularized with net (L1 and Laplacian),
		elastic-net (L1 and L2) or lasso (L1) penalty, and their
		adaptive forms, such as adaptive lasso and net adjusting for
		signs of linked coefficients. In addition, it treats the number
		of non-zero coefficients as another tuning parameter and
		simultaneously selects with the regularization parameter. The
		package uses one-step coordinate descent algorithm and runs
		extremely fast by taking into account the sparsity structure of
		coefficients.
