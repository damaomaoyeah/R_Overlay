		SQL Server R Database Interface (DBI) // RSQLServer wraps the
		jTDS Project's JDBC 3.0 SQL Server driver and extends the RJDBC
		classes and DBI methods. It defines a SQLServerDriver,
		SQLServerConnection  SQLServerRsult S4 classes as extensions of
		the RJDBC equivalent classes. Most of the DBI methods will
		simply be calls to methods defined by RJDBC classes. However,
		the dbConnect and some of the dbGetInfo methods are specific to
		SQL Server. The jTDS drivers do extend to Sybase SQL Server,
		but currently, only Microsoft SQL Server is supported by this
		package.
