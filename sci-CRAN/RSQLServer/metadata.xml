		SQL Server R Database Interface (DBI) and dplyr SQL Backend //
		Utilises The jTDS Project's JDBC 3.0 SQL Server driver to
		extend the RJDBC classes and DBI methods. It defines a
		SQLServerDriver, SQLServerConnection  SQLServerRsult S4 classes
		as extensions of the RJDBC equivalent classes with most DBI
		methods being thin extensions of the methods defined by RJDBC
		classes. However, the dbConnect interface is more convenient,
		and the data reading and writing capabilities found in RJDBC's
		fetch and dbWriteTable methods have been refined. The package
		also implements a SQL backend to the dplyr package.
