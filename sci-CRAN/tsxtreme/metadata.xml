		Bayesian Modelling of Extremal Dependence in Time Series //
		Characterisation of the extremal dependence structure of time
		series, avoiding pre-processing and filtering as done typically
		with peaks-over-threshold methods. It uses the conditional
		approach of Heffernan and Tawn (2004)
		DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2004.02050.x which is very flexible in
		terms of extremal and asymptotic dependence structures, and
		Bayesian methods improve efficiency and allow for deriving
		measures of uncertainty. For example, the extremal index,
		related to the size of clusters in time, can be estimated and
		samples from its posterior distribution obtained.
