		Equivalence to control // The package allows selecting those
		treatments of a one-way layout being equivalent to a control.
		Bonferroni adjusted "two one-sided t-tests" (TOST) and related
		simultaneous confidence intervals are given for both
		differences or ratios of means of normally distributed data.
		For the case of equal variances and balanced sample sizes for
		the treatment groups, the single-step procedure of Bofinger and
		Bofinger (1995) can be chosen. For non-normal data, the
		Wilcoxon test is applied.
