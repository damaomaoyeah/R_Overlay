		Runiversal - Package for converting R objects to Java variables
		and XML. // This package contains some functions for converting
		R objects to Java style variables and XML. Generated Java code
		is interpretable by dynamic Java libraries such as Beanshell.
		Calling R externally and handling the Java or XML output is an
		other way to call R from other languages without native
		interfaces. For a Java implementation of this approach visit
		http://www.mhsatman.com/rcaller.php and
