		Time Projections // Extract useful time components of a date
		object, such as day of week, weekend, holiday, day of month,
		etc, and put it in a data frame.  This can be used to create
		many predictor variables out of a single time variable, which
		can then be used in a regression or decision tree.  Also
		includes function plotCalendarHeatmap which draws a calendar
		and overlays a heatmap based on values.
