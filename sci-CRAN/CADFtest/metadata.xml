		This package performs the CADF unit root test proposed in Hansen
		(1995). // This package performs Hansen's (1995) Covariate-
		Augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) test. The only required argument
		is y, the Tx1 time series to be tested. If no stationary
		covariate X is passed to the procedure, then an ordinary ADF
		test is performed. The p-values of the test are computed using
		a procedure proposed in Costantini, Lupi and Popp (2007),
		illustrated in Lupi (2009).
