		Regression and similarity evaluation for memory-based learning in
		spectral chemometrics. // This package implements functions for
		spectral similarity/dissimilarity analysis and memory-based
		learning (MBL) for non-linear modelling in complex spectral
		datasets. MBL is also known as local modelling in the
		chemometrics literature.
