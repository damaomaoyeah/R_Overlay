		Embedded Conic Solver in R // R interface to the Embedded COnic
		Solver (ECOS), an efficient and robust C library for convex
		problems. Conic and equality constraints can be specified in
		addition to integer and boolean variable constraints for mixed-
		integer problems. This R interface is inspired by the python
