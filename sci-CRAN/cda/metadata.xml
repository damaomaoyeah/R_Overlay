		Coupled dipole approximation of light scattering by clusters of
		nanoparticles // Solves the electromagnetic problem of coupled-
		dipoles (scattering and absorption by a cluster of
		subwavelength particles in arbitrary 3D configuration) by
		setting up the interaction matrix and solving the linear system
		for multiple incident fields. Functions are provided for linear
		polarisation as well as circular polarisation with full angular
		averaging (optical activity). Retardation is included in the
		dipole-dipole interaction.
