		Coupled-Dipole Approximation for Electromagnetic Scattering by
		Three-Dimensional Clusters of Sub-Wavelength Particles //
		Coupled-dipole simulations for electromagnetic scattering of
		light by sub-wavelength particles in arbitrary 3-dimensional
		configurations. Scattering and absorption spectra are simulated
		by inversion of the interaction matrix, or by an order-of-
		scattering approximation scheme. High-level functions are
		provided to simulate spectra with varying angles of incidence,
		as well as with full angular averaging.
