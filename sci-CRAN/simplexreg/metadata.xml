		Regression Analysis of Proportional Data Using Simplex
		Distribution // Simplex density, distribution, quantile
		functions as well as random variable generation of the simplex
		distribution are given. Regression analysis of proportional
		data using various kinds of simplex models is available. In
		addition, GEE method can be applied to longitudinal data to
		model the correlation. Residual analysis is also involved. Some
		subroutines are written in C with GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
		so as to facilitate the computation.
