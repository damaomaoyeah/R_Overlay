		Beta Drift Analysis // Beta drift poses a serious challenge to
		asset managers and financial researchers. Beta drift causes
		problems in asset pricing models and can have serious
		ramifications for hedging attempts. Providing users with a tool
		that allows them to quantify beta drift and form educated
		opinions about it is the primary purpose of this package. This
		package contains the BDA() function that performs a beta drift
		analysis, typically for multi-factor asset pricing models. The
		BDA() function tests the underlying model parameters for drift
		across time, drift across model horizon, and applies a
		jackknife procedure to the baseline model. This allows the
		users to draw conclusions about the stability of model
		parameters or make inferences about the behavior of funds. For
		example, the drift of parameters for active funds could be
		interpreted as implicit style drift or, in the case of passive
		funds, management's inability to track a benchmark completely.
