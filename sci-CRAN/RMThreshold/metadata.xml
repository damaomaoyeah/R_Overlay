		Signal-Noise Separation in Random Matrices by using Eigenvalue
		Spectrum Analysis // An algorithm which can be used to
		determine an objective threshold for signal-noise separation in
		large random matrices (correlation matrices, mutual information
		matrices, network adjacency matrices) is provided. The package
		makes use of the results of Random Matrix Theory (RMT). The
		algorithm increments a suppositional threshold monotonically,
		thereby recording the eigenvalue spacing distribution of the
		matrix. According to RMT, that distribution undergoes a
		characteristic change when the threshold properly separates
		signal from noise. By using the algorithm, the modular
		structure of a matrix - or of the corresponding network - can
		be unraveled.
