		Lazy SQL Programming // Helper functions to build SQL statements
		for dbGetQuery or dbSendQuery under program control. They are
		intended to increase speed of coding and to reduce coding
		errors. Arguments are carefully checked, in particular SQL
		identifiers such as names of tables or columns. More patterns
		will be added as required.
