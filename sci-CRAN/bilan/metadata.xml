		Bilan water balance model // The input data into the model are
		daily or monthly series of basin average precipitation and air
		temperature. The structure of the model is formed by a system
		of relationships describing basic principles of water balance
		on ground, in the zone of aeration, including the effect of
		vegetation cover, and in the saturated zone. Air temperature is
		used as an indicator of energy conditions, which affect
		significantly the water balance components, in particular the
		development and melting of snow cover. The potential
		evapotranspiration is estimated either by a simple radiation
		-based method, which considers temperature, day of the year and
		latitude of the basin or by empirical relationships considering
		vegetation zone and relative humidity.
