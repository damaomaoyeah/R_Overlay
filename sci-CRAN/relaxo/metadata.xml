		Relaxed Lasso // Relaxed Lasso is a generalisation of the Lasso
		shrinkage technique for linear regression. Both variable
		selection and parameter estimation is achieved by regular
		Lasso, yet both steps do not necessarily use the same penalty
		parameter. The results include all standard Lasso solutions but
		allow often for sparser models while having similar or even
		slightly better predictive performance if many predictor
		variables are present. The package depends on the LARS package.
