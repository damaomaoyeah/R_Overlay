		Bayesian Dynamical System Model // The package bdynsys for
		panel/longitudinal data combines methods to model changes in up
		to four indicators over times as a function of the indicators
		themselves and up to three predictors using ordinary
		differential equations (ODEs) with polynomial terms that allow
		to model complex and nonlinear effects. A Bayesian model
		selection approach is implemented. The package provides also
		visualisation tools to plot phase portraits of the dynamic
		system, showing the complex co-evolution of two indicators over
		time with the possibility to highlight trajectories for
		specified entities (e.g. countries, individuals). Furthermore
		the visualisation tools allow for making predictions of the
		trajectories of specified entities with respect to the
		indicators.
