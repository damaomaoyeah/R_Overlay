		Social Position Indicators Construction Toolbox // Provides to
		sociologists (and related scientists) a toolbox to facilitate
		the construction of social position indicators from survey
		data. Social position indicators refer to what is commonly
		known as social class and social status. There exists in the
		sociological literature many theoretical conceptualisation and
		empirical operationalization of social class and social status.
		This first version of the package offers tools to construct the
		International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status
		(ISEI) and the Oesch social class schema. It also provides
		tools to convert several occupational classifications (PCS82,
		PCS03, and ISCO08) into a common one (ISCO88) to facilitate
		data harmonisation work, and tools to collapse (i.e. group)
		modalities of social position indicators.
