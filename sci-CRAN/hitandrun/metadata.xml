		"Hit and Run" and "Shake and Bake" for Sampling Uniformly from
		Convex Shapes // The "Hit and Run" Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		method for sampling uniformly from convex shapes defined by
		linear constraints, and the "Shake and Bake" method for
		sampling from the boundary of such shapes. Includes specialized
		functions for sampling normalized weights with arbitrary linear
		constraints.
