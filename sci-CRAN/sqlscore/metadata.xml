		R Utilities for Generating SQL Queries from Model Objects // The
		sqlscore package provides utilities for generating SQL queries
		(particularly CREATE TABLE statements) from R model objects.
		The most important use case is generating SQL to score a
		generalized linear model or related model represented as an R
		object, in which case the package handles parsing formula
		operators and including the model's response function.
