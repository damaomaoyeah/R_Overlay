		Sequential Input Selection Algorithm // Implements the SISAL
		algorithm by Tikka and Hollmn. It is a sequential backward
		selection algorithm which uses a linear model in a cross-
		validation setting. Starting from the full model, one variable
		at a time is removed based on the regression coefficients. From
		this set of models, a parsimonious (sparse) model is found by
		choosing the model with the smallest number of variables among
		those models where the validation error is smaller than a
		threshold. Also implements extensions which explore larger
		parts of the search space and/or use ridge regression instead
		of ordinary least squares.
