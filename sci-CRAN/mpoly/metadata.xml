		Symbolic computation and more with multivariate polynomials //
		mpoly allows for the symbolic manipulation of multivariate
		polynomials in a general and consistent way designed especially
		for sparse and super sparse polynomials.  It also allows for
		basic differential calculus with multivariate polynomials and
		Grobner basis calculations from computational algebraic
		geometry.
