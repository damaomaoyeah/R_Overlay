		Dental Surface Complexity Measurement Tools // Surface topography
		calculations of Dirichlet's normal energy, relief index,
		surface slope, and orientation patch count for teeth using
		scans of enamel caps. Importantly, for the relief index and
		orientation patch count calculations to work, the scanned tooth
		files must be oriented with the occlusal plane parallel to the
		x and y axes, and perpendicular to the z axis. The files should
		also be simplified, and smoothed in some other software prior
		to uploading into R.
