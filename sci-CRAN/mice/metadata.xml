		Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations // Multiple
		imputation using Fully Conditional Specification (FCS)
		implemented by the MICE algorithm as described in Van Buuren
		and Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011) doi:10.18637/jss.v045.i03. Each
		variable has its own imputation model. Built-in imputation
		models are provided for continuous data (predictive mean
		matching, normal), binary data (logistic regression), unordered
		categorical data (polytomous logistic regression) and ordered
		categorical data (proportional odds). MICE can also impute
		continuous two-level data (normal model, pan, second-level
		variables). Passive imputation can be used to maintain
		consistency between variables. Various diagnostic plots are
		available to inspect the quality of the imputations.
