		Parallelized Genomic Prediction and GWAS // Frequently used
		methods in genomic applications with emphasis on parallel
		computing (OpenMP). At its core, the package has a Gibbs
		Sampler that allows running univariate linear mixed models that
		have both, sparse and dense design matrices. The parallel
		sampling method in case of dense design matrices (e.g.
		Genotypes) allows running Ridge Regression or BayesA for a very
		large number of individuals. The Gibbs Sampler is capable of
		running Single Step Genomic Prediction models. In addition, the
		package offers parallelized functions for common tasks like
		genome-wide association studies and cross validation in a
		memory efficient way.
