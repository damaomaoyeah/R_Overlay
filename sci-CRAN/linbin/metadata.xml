		Binning and Plotting of Linearly Referenced Data // Short for
		'linear binning', the linbin package provides functions for
		manipulating, binning, and plotting linearly referenced data.
		Although developed for data collected on river networks, it can
		be used with any interval or point data referenced to a
		1-dimensional coordinate system. Flexible bin generation and
		batch processing makes it easy to compute and visualize
		variables at multiple scales, useful for identifying patterns
		within and between variables and investigating the influence of
		scale of observation on data interpretation.
