		Generation of Multivariate Data with Arbitrary Marginals // An
		implementation of a specific method for generating
		n-dimensional random vectors with given marginal distributions
		and correlation matrix. The method uses the NORTA (NORmal To
		Anything) approach which generates a standard normal random
		vector and then transforms it into a random vector with
		specified marginal distributions and the RA (Retrospective
		Approximation) algorithm which is a generic stochastic root-
		finding algorithm. The marginals can be continuous or discrete.
		See the vignette of package for more details.
