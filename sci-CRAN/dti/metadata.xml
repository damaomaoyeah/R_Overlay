		Analysis of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) Data // Diffusion
		Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging
		modality, that measures diffusion of water in tissues like the
		human brain. The package contains R-functions to process
		diffusion-weighted data. The functionality includes diffusion
		tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI),
		modeling for high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging
		(HARDI) using Q-ball-reconstruction and tensor mixture models,
		several methods for structural adaptive smoothing including
		POAS and msPOAS, and a streamline fiber tracking for tensor and
		tensor mixture models. The package provides functionality to
		manipulate and visualize results in 2D and 3D.
