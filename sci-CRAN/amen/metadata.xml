		Additive and Multiplicative Effects Models for Networks and
		Relational Data // Analysis of network and relational data
		using additive and multiplicative effects (AME) models. The
		basic model includes regression terms, the covariance structure
		of the social relations model (Warner, Kenny and Stoto (1979),
		Wong (1982)), and multiplicative factor models (Hoff(2009)).
		Four different link functions accommodate different relational
		data structures, including binary/network data (bin), normal
		relational data (nrm), ordinal relational data (ord) and data
		from fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).  Several of these
		link functions are discussed in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and
		Stovel (2013). Development of this software was supported in
		part by NICHD grant R01HD067509.
