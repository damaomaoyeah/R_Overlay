		Calculate and Plot Decision Curves // Decision curves are a
		useful tool to evaluate the population impact of adopting a
		risk prediction instrument into clinical practice. Given one or
		more instruments (risk models) that predict the probability of
		a binary outcome, this package calculates and plots decision
		curves, which display estimates of the standardized net benefit
		by the probability threshold used to categorize observations as
		'high risk.' Curves can be estimated using data from an
		observational cohort, or from case-control studies when an
		estimate of the population outcome prevalence is available.
		Confidence intervals calculated using the bootstrap can be
		displayed and a wrapper function to calculate cross-validated
		curves using k-fold cross-validation is also provided.
