		Descriptive Statistics, Inference, Regression, and Plotting in an
		Introductory Statistics Course // A set of tools designed to
		facilitate easy adoption of R for students in introductory
		classes with little programming experience. Compiles output
		from existing routines together in an intuitive format, and
		adds functionality to existing functions. For instance, the
		regression function can perform linear models, generalized
		linear models, Cox models, or generalized estimating equations.
		The user can also specify multiple-partial F-tests to print out
		with the model coefficients. We also give many routines for
		descriptive statistics and plotting.
