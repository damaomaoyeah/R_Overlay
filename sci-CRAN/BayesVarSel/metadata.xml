		Bayes Factors, Model Choice And Variable Selection In Linear
		Models // Conceived to calculate Bayes factors in linear models
		and then to provide a formal Bayesian answer to testing and
		variable selection problems. From a theoretical side, the
		emphasis in the package is placed on the prior distributions
		and BayesVarSel allows using a wide range of them: Jeffreys-
		Zellner-Siow (Jeffreys, 1961; Zellner and Siow, 1980,1984)
		Zellner (1986); Fernandez et al. (2001), Liang et al. (2008)
		and Bayarri et al. (2012). The interaction with the package is
		through a friendly interface that syntactically mimics the
		well-known lm command of R. The resulting objects can be easily
		explored providing the user very valuable information (like
		marginal, joint and conditional inclusion probabilities of
		potential variables; the highest posterior probability model,
		HPM; the median probability model, MPM) about the structure of
		the true -data generating- model. Additionally, BayesVarSel
		incorporates abilities to handle problems with a large number
		of potential explanatory variables through parallel and
		heuristic versions (Garcia-Donato and Martinez-Beneito 2013) of
		the main commands.
