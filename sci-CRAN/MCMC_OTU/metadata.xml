		Bayesian analysis of multivariate counts data // This package
		implements poisson-lognormal generalized linear mixed model
		analysis of multivariate counts data using MCMC, aiming to
		infer the changes in relative proportions of individual
		variables. The package was originally designed for sequence-
		based analysis of microbial communities ("metabarcoding",
		variables = operational taxonomic units, OTUs), but can be used
		for other types of multivariate counts, such as in ecological
		applications (variables = species). The results are summarized
		and plotted using ggplot2 functions. Includes functions to
		remove sample and variable outliers and reformat counts into
		normalized log-transformed values for correlation and principal
		component/coordinate analysis. Walkthrough and examples: http:/
