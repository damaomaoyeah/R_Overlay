		Bayesian Analysis of Multivariate Counts Data in DNA
		Metabarcoding and Ecology // Poisson-lognormal generalized
		linear mixed model analysis of multivariate counts data using
		MCMC, aiming to infer the changes in relative proportions of
		individual variables. The package was originally designed for
		sequence-based analysis of microbial communities
		("metabarcoding", variables = operational taxonomic units,
		OTUs), but can be used for other types of multivariate counts,
		such as in ecological applications (variables = species). The
		results are summarized and plotted using 'ggplot2' functions.
		Includes functions to remove sample and variable outliers and
		reformat counts into normalized log-transformed values for
		correlation and principal component/coordinate analysis.
		Walkthrough and examples: http://www.bio.utexas.edu/research/ma
