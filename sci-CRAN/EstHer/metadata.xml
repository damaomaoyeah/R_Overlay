		Estimation of Heritability in High Dimensional Sparse Linear
		Mixed Models using Variable Selection // Our method is a
		variable selection method to select active components in sparse
		linear mixed models in order to estimate the heritability. The
		selection allows us to reduce the size of the data sets which
		improves the accuracy of the estimations. Our package also
		provides a confidence interval for the estimated heritability.
