		Local Approximate Gaussian Process Regression // Performs
		approximate GP regression for large computer experiments and
		spatial datasets.  The approximation is based on finding small
		local designs for prediction (independently) at particular
		inputs. OpenMP and SNOW parallelization are supported for
		prediction over a vast out-of-sample testing set; GPU
		acceleration is also supported for an important subroutine.
		OpenMP and GPU features may require special compilation.  An
		interface to lower-level (full) GP inference and prediction is
		also provided, as are associated wrapper routines for blackbox
		optimization under constraints via an augmented Lagrangian
		scheme, and large scale computer model calibration.
