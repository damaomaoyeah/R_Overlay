		Analysis and Visualization of Plant Leaf Angle Distributions // A
		leaf angle distribution is a special distribution that is
		defined between 0 and 90 degrees, and a number of distributions
		are used to characterize the leaf angle distribution in real
		plant canopies. This package includes methods to fit
		distributions to data, visualize the fit, and compare fits of
		nine different distributions.
