		Write Storm Bolts in R using the Storm Multi-Language Protocol.
		// Storm is a distributed real-time computation system. Similar
		to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing
		batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives
		for doing real-time computation. . Storm includes a "Multi-
		Language" (or "Multilang") Protocol to allow implementation of
		Bolts and Spouts in languages other than Java.  This R
		extension provides implementations of utility functions to
		allow an application developer to focus on application-specific
		functionality rather than Storm/R communications plumbing.
