		Periodicity Tests in Short Time Series // Implements p-value
		computations using an approximation to the cumulative
		distribution function for a variety of tests for periodicity.
		These tests include harmonic regression tests with normal and
		double exponential errors as well as modifications of Fisher's
		g test. An accompanying vignette illustrates the application of
		these tests.
