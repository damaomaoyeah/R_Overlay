		FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) utilities // Utilities to
		read and write files in the FITS (Flexible Image Transport
		System) format, a standard format in astronomy. Present low-
		level routines allow: reading, parsing, and modifying FITS
		headers; reading FITS images (multi-dimensional arrays);
		reading FITS binary tables; and writing FITS images (multi-
		dimensional arrays).  Higher-level functions allow: reading
		files composed of one or more headers and a single (perhaps
		multidimensional) image or single bintable; reading bintables
		into data frames; generating vectors for image array axes;
		scaling and writing images as 16-bit integers.  Known
		incompletenesses are reading FITS ASCII table and random group
		extensions, as well as bit, complex, and array descriptor data
		types in binary tables.
