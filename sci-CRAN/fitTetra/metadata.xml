		fitTetra is an R package for assigning tetraploid genotype scores
		// Package fitTetra contains three functions that can be used
		to assign genotypes to a collection of tetraploid samples based
		on bialleleic marker assays. Functions fitTetra (to fit several
		models for one marker from the data and select the best
		fitting) or saveMarkerModels (calls fitTetra for multiple
		markers and saves the results to files) will probably be the
		most convenient to use. Function CodomMarker offers more
		control and fits one specified model for a given marker.
