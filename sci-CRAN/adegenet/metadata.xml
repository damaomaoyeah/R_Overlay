		Exploratory Analysis of Genetic and Genomic Data // Toolset for
		the exploration of genetic and genomic data. Adegenet provides
		formal (S4) classes for storing and handling various genetic
		data, including genetic markers with varying ploidy and
		hierarchical population structure ('genind' class), alleles
		counts by populations ('genpop'), and genome-wide SNP data
		('genlight'). It also implements original multivariate methods
		(DAPC, sPCA), graphics, statistical tests, simulation tools,
		distance and similarity measures, and several spatial methods.
		A range of both empirical and simulated datasets is also
		provided to illustrate various methods.
