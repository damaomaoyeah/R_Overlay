		Analysis of Kin-Cohort Studies // Analysis of kin-cohort studies.
		kin.cohort provides estimates of age-specific cumulative risk
		of a disease for carriers and noncarriers of a mutation. The
		cohorts are retrospectively built from relatives of probands
		for whom the genotype is known. Currently the method of moments
		and marginal maximum likelihood are implemented. Confidence
		intervals are calculated from bootstrap samples. Most of the
		code is a translation from previous 'MATLAB' code by N.
		Chatterjee.
