		Uses an Archive to Amend Previous Stages of a Pipe using Current
		Output // Remedies a common problem in piping: not having
		access to intermediate outputs of the pipe. Within a "loop", a
		piping intermediate is  stored in a stack archive, data is
		processed, and then both the stored intermediate and the
		current output are reintegrated using an "ending" function. Two
		special ending functions are provided: amend and insert.
		However, any ending function can be specified, including merge
		functions, join functions, setNames(), etc. This framework
		allows the following work-flow: focus on a particular aspect or
		section of a data set, conduct specific operations, and then
		reintegrate changes into the whole.
