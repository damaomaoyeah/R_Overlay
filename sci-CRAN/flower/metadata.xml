		Tools for characterizing flowering traits // Flowering is an
		important life history trait of flowering plants. It has been
		mainly analyzed with respect to flowering onset and duration of
		flowering. This tools provide some functions to compute the
		temporal distribution of an flowering individual related to
		other population members. fCV() measures the temporal variation
		in flowering. RIind() measures the rank order of flowering for
		individual plants within a population. SI(), SI2(), SI3(), and
		SI4() calculate flowering synchrony with different methods.
