		Robust Variance Meta-Regression // Functions for conducting
		robust variance estimation (RVE) meta-regression using both
		large and small sample RVE estimators under various weighting
		schemes. These methods are distribution free and provide valid
		point estimates, standard errors and hypothesis tests even when
		the degree and structure of dependence between effect sizes is
		unknown. Also included are functions for conducting sensitivity
		analyses under correlated effects weighting and producing RVE-
		based forest plots.
