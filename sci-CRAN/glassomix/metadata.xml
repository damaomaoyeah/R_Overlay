		High dimensional Mixture Graph Models selection // The  package
		glassomix provides a general framework  for network recovering
		through a model-based soft clustering. It provides functions
		for parameter estimation via the EM algorithm for Gaussian
		graphical mixture models in high dimensional setting. The main
		function is ``glasso.mix'' upon which a model selection is
		performed. The package estimates the optimum number of mixture
		components, K and the tuning parameter, lambda, based on the
		Extended Bayesian Information Criteria (EBIC) via ``select.gm''
		function. The graphical structural of the K-networks are also
		plotted through the function ``gm.plot''
