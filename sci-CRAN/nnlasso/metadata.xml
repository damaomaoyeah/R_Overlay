		Non-Negative Lasso and Elastic Net Penalized Generalized Linear
		Models // Estimates of coefficients of lasso penalized linear
		regression and generalized linear models subject to non-
		negativity constraints on the parameters using multiplicative
		iterative algorithm. Entire regularization path for a sequence
		of lambda values can be obtained. Functions are available for
		creating plots of regularization path, cross validation and
		estimating coefficients at a given lambda value. There is also
		provision for obtaining standard error of coefficient
		estimates.
