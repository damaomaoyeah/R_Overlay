		Create Badges for 'Travis', 'Repostatus' 'Codecov.io' Etc in
		Github Readme // Tired of copy and pasting almost identical
		markdown for badges in every new R package that you create on
		Github? This package will search your DESCRIPTION file and
		extract the package name, licence, R-version, and current
		projectversion and transform that into badges. It will also
		search for a .travis.yml file and create a 'Travis' badge, if
		you use 'Codecov.io' to check your code coverage after a
		'Travis' build this package will also build a
		'Codecov.io'-badge. All the badges will be placed below the top
		YAML content of your Rmarkdown file (Readme.Rmd). Currently
		creates badges for  Projectstatus (Repostatus.org), licence
		travis build status, codecov, minimal R version, CRAN status,
		current version of your package and last change of Readme.Rmd.
