		Create Waterfall Charts using 'ggplot2' Simply // A not uncommon
		task for quants is to create 'waterfall charts'. There seems to
		be no simple way to do this in 'ggplot2' currently. This
		package contains a single function (waterfall) that simply
		draws a waterfall chart in a 'ggplot2' object. Some flexibility
		is provided, though often the object created will need to be
		modified through a theme.
