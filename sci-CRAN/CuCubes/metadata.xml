		MultiDimensional Feature Selection (MDFS) // Functions for
		MultiDimensional Feature Selection (MDFS): * calculating
		multidimensional information gains, * finding interesting
		tuples for chosen variables, * scoring variables, * finding
		important variables, * plotting selection results. CuCubes is
		also known as CUDA Cubes and it is a library that allows fast
		CUDA-accelerated computation of information gains in binary
		classification problems. This package wraps CuCubes and
		provides an alternative CPU version as well as helper functions
		for building MultiDimensional Feature Selectors.
