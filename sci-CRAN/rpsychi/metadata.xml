		Statistics for psychiatric research // The rpsychi offers a
		number of functions for psychiatry, psychiatric nursing,
		clinical psychology. Functions are primarily for statistical
		significance testing using published work. For example, you can
		conduct a factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), which
		requires only the mean, standard deviation, and sample size for
		each cell, rather than the individual data. This package covers
		fundamental statistical tests such as t-test, chi-square test,
		analysis of variance, and multiple regression analysis. With
		some exceptions, you can obtain effect size and its confidence
		interval. These functions help you to obtain effect size from
		published work, and then to conduct a priori power analysis or
		meta-analysis, even if a researcher do not report effect size
		in a published work.
