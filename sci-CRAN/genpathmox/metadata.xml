		Generalized PATHMOX Algorithm for PLS-PM, LS and LAD Regression
		// genpathmox provides a very interesting solution for handling
		segmentation variables in complex statistical methodology. It
		contains en extended version of the PATHMOX algorithm in the
		context of partial least square path modeling (Sanchez, 2009)
		including the F-block test (to detect the responsible latent
		endogenous equations of the difference), the F-coefficient (to
		detect the path coefficients responsible of the difference) and
		the invariance test (to realize a comparison between the sub-
		models' latent variables). Furthermore, the package contains a
		generalized version of the PATHMOX algorithm to approach
		different methodologies: linear regression and least absolute
		regression models.
