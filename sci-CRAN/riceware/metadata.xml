		A Diceware Passphrase Implementation // The Diceware method can
		be used to generate strong passphrases. In short, you roll a
		6-faced dice 5 times in a row, the number obtained is matched
		against a dictionary of easily remembered word. By combining
		together 7 words thus generated, you obtain a password that is
		relatively easy to remember, but would take several millions
		years (on average) for a powerful computer to guess.
