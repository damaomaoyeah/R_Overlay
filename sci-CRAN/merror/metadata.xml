		Accuracy and Precision of Measurements // N=3 methods are used to
		measure each of n items. The data are used to estimate
		simultaneously systematic error (bias) and random error
		(imprecision). Observed measurements for each method or device
		are assumed to be linear functions of the unknown true values
		and the errors are assumed normally distributed. Maximum
		likelihood estimation is used for the imprecision standard
		deviation estimates. Pairwise calibration curves and plots can
		be easily generated.
