		Permutation Based QQ Plot and Inflation Factor Estimation //
		Provides users the necessary utility functions to generate
		permutation-based QQ plots and also estimate inflation factor
		based on the empirical NULL distribution. While it has general
		utility, it is particularly helpful when the skewness of the
		Fisher's Exact test in sparse data situations with imbalanced
		case-control sample sizes renders the reliance on the uniform
		chi-square expected distribution inappropriate.
