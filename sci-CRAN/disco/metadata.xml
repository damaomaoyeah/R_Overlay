		Discordance and Concordance of Transcriptomic Responses //
		Concordance and discordance of homologous gene regulation
		allows comparing reaction to stimuli in different organisms,
		for example human patients and animal models of a disease. The
		package contains functions to calculate discordance and
		concordance score for homologous gene pairs, identify
		concordantly or discordantly regulated transcriptional modules
		and visualize the results. It is intended for analysis of
		transcriptional data.
