		Functions for Robust Variable Handling // Variables are the
		fundamental parts of each programming language but handling
		them might be frustrating for programmers from time to time.
		This package contains some functions to help user (especially
		data explorers) to make more sense of their variables and take
		the most out of variables as well as their hardware. These
		functions are written, collected and crafted over some years of
		experience in statistical data analysis and for each of them
		there was a need. Functions in this package are suppose to be
		efficient and easy to use, hence they will be frequently
		updated to make them more convenient.
