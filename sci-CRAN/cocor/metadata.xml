		Comparing Correlations // Statistical tests for the comparison
		between two correlations based on either independent or
		dependent groups. Dependent correlations can either be
		overlapping or nonoverlapping. A web interface is available at
		http://comparingcorrelations.org. A plugin for the R GUI and
		IDE RKWard is included. Please install RKWard from
		https://rkward.kde.org to use this feature. The respective R
		package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a
		repository, as it is a part of RKWard.
