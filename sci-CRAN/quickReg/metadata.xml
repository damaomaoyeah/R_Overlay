		Build Regression Models Quickly and Display the Results Using
		'ggplot2' // A set of functions to extract results from
		regression models and plot the effect size using 'ggplot2'
		seamlessly. While 'broom' is useful to convert statistical
		analysis objects into tidy data frames, 'coefplot' is adept at
		showing multivariate regression results. With specific outcome,
		this package could build regression models automatically,
		extract results into a data frame and provide a quicker way to
		summarize models' statistical findings using 'ggplot2'.
