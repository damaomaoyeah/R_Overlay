		Feasible Solution Algorithm for Finding Best Subsets and
		Interactions // Uses the lm() and glm() functions to fit models
		generated from a feasible solution algorithm. The feasible
		solution algorithm comes up with model forms of a specific type
		that can have fixed variables, higher order interactions and
		their lower order terms.
