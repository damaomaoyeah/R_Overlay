		Linear Model Data Simulation and Design of Computer Experiments
		// Facilitates data simulation from a random regression model
		where the data properties can be controlled by a few input
		parameters. The data simulation is based on the concept of
		relevant latent components and relevant predictors, and was
		developed for the purpose of testing methods for variable
		selection for prediction. Included are also functions for
		designing computer experiments in order to investigate the
		effects of the data properties on the performance of the tested
		methods. The design is constructed using the Multi-level Binary
		Replacement (MBR) design approach which makes it possible to
		set up fractional designs for multi-factor problems with
		potentially many levels for each factor.
