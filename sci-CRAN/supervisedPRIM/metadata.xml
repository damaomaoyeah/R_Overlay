		Supervised Classification Learning and Prediction using Patient
		Rule Induction Method (PRIM) // The Patient Rule Induction
		Method (PRIM) is typically used for "bump hunting" data mining
		to identify regions with abnormally high concentrations of data
		with large or small values. This package extends this
		methodology so that it can be applied to binary classification
		problems and used for prediction.
