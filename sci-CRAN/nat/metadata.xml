		nat: NeuroAnatomy Toolbox for Analysis of 3D Image Data // This
		package is a reboot of the AnalysisSuite
		(https://github.com/jefferis/AnalysisSuite) bundle of R code
		that I have been using for a number of years to analyse and
		visualise 3D biological image data, especially traced neurons.
		AnalysisSuite is most easily installed using the nat.as package
		presently available at https://github.com/jefferis/nat.as. The
		nat package is considerably cleaner but currently provides only
		a subset of the full functionality of nat.as / AnalysisSuite.
		nat can read and write 3D images in NRRD and Amira formats and
		read surfaces in Amira's hxsurf format. Traced neurons can be
		imported from and written to SWC and Amira LineSet and
		SkeletonGraph formats. These data can then be visualised in 3D
		via rgl, manipulated including applying calculated
		registrations, e.g. using the CMTK registration suite, and
		analysed. The package also has a simple representation for
		neurons that have been subjected to a 3D skeletonisation but
		not formally traced; this allows morphological comparison
		between neurons including searches and clustering.
