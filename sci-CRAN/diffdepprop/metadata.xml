		Calculates Confidence Intervals for two Dependent Proportions //
		The package includes functions to calculate confidence
		intervals for the difference of dependent proportions. There
		are two functions implemented to edit the data (dichotomising
		with the help of cutpoints, counting accordance and discordance
		of two tests or situations). For the calculation of the
		confidence intervals entries of the fourfold table are needed.
