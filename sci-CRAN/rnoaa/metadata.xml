		NOAA climate data from R. // This is an R wrapper to many NOAA
		APIs including the NCDC climate API at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov
		/cdo-web/webservices/v2. There are functions for each of the
		API endpoints: data, data categories, data sets, data types,
		locations, location categories, and stations. In addition, we
		have an interface for NOAA sea ice data that is not part of the
		climate data API, the NOAA severe weather inventory, and ERDDAP
		data. NOAA buoy data is only on the buoy branch in the Github
		repository for this package (see url below).
