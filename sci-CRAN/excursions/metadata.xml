		Excursion Sets and Contour Credibility Regions for Random Fields
		// Functions that compute probabilistic excursion sets, contour
		credibility regions, contour avoiding regions, and simultaneous
		confidence bands for latent gaussian random processes and
		fields. The package also contains functions that calculate
		these quantities for models estimated with the INLA package.
