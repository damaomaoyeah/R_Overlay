		S3 Infrastructure for Regular and Irregular Time Series (Z's
		Ordered Observations) // An S3 class with methods for totally
		ordered indexed observations. It is particularly aimed at
		irregular time series of numeric vectors/matrices and factors.
		zoo's key design goals are independence of a particular
		index/date/time class and consistency with ts and base R by
		providing methods to extend standard generics.
