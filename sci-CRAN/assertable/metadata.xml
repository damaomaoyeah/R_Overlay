		Verbose Assertions for Tabular Data (Data.frames and Data.tables)
		// Simple, flexible, assertions on data.frame or data.table
		objects with verbose output for vetting. While other assertion
		packages apply towards more general use-cases, assertable is
		tailored towards tabular data. It includes functions to check
		variable names and values, whether the dataset contains all
		combinations of a given set of unique identifiers, and whether
		it is a certain length. In addition, assertable includes
		utility functions to check the existence of target files and to
		efficiently import multiple tabular data files into one
		data.table.
