		Diagnostic test summary measures for three ordinal groups // The
		R package provides utilities to estimate and make inference on
		two summary measures for diagnostic tests when there are three
		ordinal groups ----volume under ROC surface (VUS) and the
		extended Youden index, assuming that diagnostic markers
		increase monotonically and stochastically with disease
		severity. Point estimates, variance, confidence interval and
		optimal cut-points both under the normal assumption and also
		the non-parametric method(s) will be provided for the summary
		measures. Statistical tests are implemented to compare multiple
		diagnostic tests and two diagnostic test.  Sample size is
		calculated to estimate the summary measures within a user-
		specified margin of error for future study planning.
