		Software for Analyzing Limiting Dilution Assays // Calculates
		maximum likelihood estimate, exact and asymptotic confidence
		intervals, and exact and asymptotic goodness of fit p-values
		for infectious units per million (IUPM) from serial limiting
		dilution assays. This package uses the likelihood equation,
		exact PGOF, and exact confidence intervals described in Meyers
		et al. (1994) http://jcm.asm.org/content/32/3/732.full.pdf.
		This software is also implemented as a web application through
		the Shiny R package https://iupm.shinyapps.io/sldassay/.
