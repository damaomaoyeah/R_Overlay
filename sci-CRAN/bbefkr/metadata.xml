		Bayesian bandwidth estimation and semi-metric selection for the
		functional kernel regression with unknown error density //
		Estimating optimal bandwidths for the regression mean function
		approximated by the functional Nadaraya-Watson estimator and
		the error density approximated by a kernel density of residuals
		simultaneously in a scalar-on-function regression. As a by-
		product of Markov chain Monte Carlo, the optimal choice of
		semi-metric is selected based on largest marginal likelihood.
