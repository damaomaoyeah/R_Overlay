		Age-Period-Cohort Analysis // Functions for age-period-cohort
		analysis. The data can be organised in matrices indexed by age-
		cohort, age-period or cohort-period. The data can include dose
		and response or just doses.  The statistical model is a
		generalized linear model (GLM) allowing for 3,2,1 or 0 of the
		age-period-cohort factors. The canonical parametrisation of
		Kuang, Nielsen and Nielsen (2008) is used. Thus, the analysis
		does not rely on ad hoc identification.
