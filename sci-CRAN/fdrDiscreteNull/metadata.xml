		False Discovery Rate Procedure Under Discrete Null Distributions
		// It is known that current false discovery rate (FDR)
		procedures can be very conservative when applied to p-values
		(and test statistics) with discrete (and heterogeneous) null
		distributions. This package implements the more powerful
		weighted generalized FDR procedure that adapts to these two
		features of the discrete paradigm for multiple testing. The
		package takes in the original data set rather than the p-values
		in order to carry out the adjustments needed for multiple
		testing in this paradigm. The methodology applies also to
		multiple testing where the null p-values are uniformly
		distributed. The package implements the method for three types
		of test statistics and their p-values: (a) binomial test on if
		two independent Poisson distributions have the same means, (b)
		Fisher's exact test on if the conditional distribution is the
		same as the marginal distribution for two binomial
		distributions, (c) the exact negative binomial test on if two
		independent negative binomial distributions with the same size
		parameter have the same means. It depends on the R packages
		``MCMCpack'' to use its function ``dnoncenhypergeom'' for
		hypergeometric distributions, and edgeR to uses its
		normalization techniques for data that follow negative binomial
		distributions.
