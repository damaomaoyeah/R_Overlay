		Correspondence and Simultaneous Analysis // This package performs
		classical correspondence analysis (CA) and simultaneous
		analysis (SA). Simultaneous analysis is a factorial methodology
		developed for the joint treatment of a set of several
		contingency tables. In SA tables having the same rows, are
		concatenated row-wise. In this version of the package a
		multiple option have been included for the simultaneous
		analysis of tables having the same columns, concatenated
		column-wise. This way, a MSA allows to perform the analysis of
		an indicator matrix where the rows represent individuals. In
		this package, functions for computation, summaries and
		graphical visualization in two dimensions are provided,
		including options to display partial and supplementary points.
