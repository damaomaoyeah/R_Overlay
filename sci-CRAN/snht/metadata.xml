		Standard Normal Homogeneity Test // Implementation of robust and
		non-robust Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT) for
		changepoint detection.  This test statistic is equal sided, as
		proposed in "Homogenization of Radiosonde Temperature Time
		Series Using Innovation Statistics" by Haimberger, L., 2007.
		However, the statistic contains an estimate of sigma^2 in the
		denominator instead of sigma, which seems to be a more
		appropriate value (based on the paper "Homogenization of
		Swedish temperature data. Part I: Homogeneity test for linear
		trends." by Alexandersson, H., and A. Moberg, 1997).
