		The package was developed to fit fit many growth curves obtained
		under different conditions. // The package was developed to fit
		fit many growth curves obtained under different conditions in
		order to derive a conclusive dose-response curve, for instance
		for a compound that potentially affects growth. grofit fits
		data to different parametric models (function gcFitModel) and
		in addition provides a model free spline fit (function
		gcFitSpline) to circumvent systematic errors that might occur
		within application of parametric methods.
