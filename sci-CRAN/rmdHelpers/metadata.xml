		Helper Functions for Rmd Documents // A series of functions to
		aid in repeated tasks for Rmd documents. All details are to my
		personal preference, though I am happy to add flexibility if
		there are use cases I am missing. I will continue updating with
		new functions as I add utility functions for myself.
