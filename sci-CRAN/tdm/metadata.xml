		Data Analysis for Therapeutic Drug Monitoring // Therapeutic Drug
		Monitoring (TDM) is designed to estimate individual
		pharmacokinetic parameters with one or more drug serum/plasma
		concentrations obtained from a single subject or multiple
		subjects using a Bayesian inference porgram, JAGS (Just Another
		Gibbs Sampling; a computer program for analysis of Bayesian
		hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation),
		interfaced with rjags. Besides, it also can calculate a
		suggested dose based on the target drug concentration (C -D) or
		calculate a predicted drug concentration with a given dose (D -
		C).
