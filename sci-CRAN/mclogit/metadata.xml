		Mixed Conditional Logit // This packages provides a function to
		estimate parameters for the conditional logit model (also with
		multinomial counts), and for the mixed conditional logit model,
		or conditional logit with random effects (random intercepts
		only, no random slopes yet). The current implementation of
		random effects is limited to the PQL technique, which requires
		large cluster sizes.
