		Video Comparison Tool // It will take the vectors of motion for
		two videos (coming from a variant of shotdetect code allowing
		to store detailed motion vectors in JSON format, for instance)
		and it will look for comparing taking out the common chunk.
		Then, provided you have some image's hashes it will compare
		their signature in order to make up the decision about chunk
		similarity of two video files. ShotDetect is a free software
		which detects shots and scenes from a video
		(http://johmathe.name/shotdetect.html).
