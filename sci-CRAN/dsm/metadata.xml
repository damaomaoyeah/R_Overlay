		Density Surface Modelling of Distance Sampling Data // Density
		surface modelling of line transect data. A Generalized Additive
		Model-based approach is used to calculate spatially-explicit
		estimates of animal abundance from distance sampling (also
		presence/absence and strip transect) data. Several utility
		functions are provided for model checking, plotting and
		variance estimation.
