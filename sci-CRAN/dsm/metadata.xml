		Density surface modelling of distance sampling data // This
		library implements density surface modelling of line transect
		data, based on the methods of Hedley et al. (2004). Some recent
		developments in the literature have also be incorporated.
		Outputs are point and interval estimates of population
		abundance and density. Please note that this version of dsm
		WILL NOT work with the Windows package DISTANCE earlier than
		version 6.2. For a version that works with DISTANCE 6.1, please
		go to: https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/dsm-distance-6.1
		For the latest version of dsm, please use the github version at
		the URL listed below. Miller, D. L., M. L. Burt, E. Rexstad and
		L. Thomas. 2013. Spatial models for distance sampling data:
		recent developments and future directions. Methods in Ecology
		and Evolution Hedley, S.L.,  S.T. Buckland and D.L. Borchers.
