		Detects spatial outliers using a Random Walk on Bipartite Graph
		// a Bipartite graph and is constructed based on the spatial
		and/or non-spatial attributes of the spatial objects in the
		dataset. Secondly, RW techniques are utilized on the graphs to
		compute the outlierness for each point (the differences between
		spatial objects and their spatial neighbours). The top k
		objects with higher outlierness are recognized as outliers.
