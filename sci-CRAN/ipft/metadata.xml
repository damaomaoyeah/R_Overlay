		Indoor Positioning Fingerprinting Toolset // Algorithms and
		utility functions for indoor positioning using fingerprinting
		techniques. These functions are designed for manipulation of
		RSSI (Received Signal Strength Intensity) data sets, estimation
		of positions,comparison of the performance of different models,
		and graphical visualization of data. Machine learning
		algorithms and methods such as k-nearest neighbors or
		probabilistic fingerprinting are implemented in this package to
		perform analysis and estimations over RSSI data sets.
