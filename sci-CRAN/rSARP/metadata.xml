		to create, evaluate, critique, revise, track progress, and
		communicate a detailed wilderness or urban search plan to
		management. This package uses and creates csv files in the R
		working directory to document inputs and results. It also
		creates a series of PDF and PNG files to accomplish
		communication of the plan. The program creates and revises
		search plans using Bayesian models. The package includes
		functions bestsearch(), searchstatus() and searchme() to model
		the number of searchers and hours required to search an area,
		calculate the probability of detection, probability of success,
		and project the best plan given limited resources.
