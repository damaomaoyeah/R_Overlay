		Simultaneous Critical Values for t-Tests in Very High Dimensions
		// Implements the method developed by Cao and Kosorok (2011)
		for the significance analysis of thousands of features in high-
		dimensional biological studies. It is an asymptotically valid
		data-driven procedure to find critical values for rejection
		regions controlling the k-familywise error rate, false
		discovery rate, and the tail probability of false discovery
		proportion.
