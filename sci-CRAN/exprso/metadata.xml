		Rapid Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms for Genomic
		Data // Supervised machine learning has an increasingly
		important role in biological studies. However, the sheer
		complexity of classification pipelines poses a significant
		barrier to the expert biologist unfamiliar with machine
		learning. Moreover, many biologists lack the time or technical
		skills necessary to establish their own pipelines. This package
		introduces a framework for the rapid implementation of high-
		throughput supervised machine learning built with the biologist
		user in mind. Written by biologists, for biologists, this
		package provides a user-friendly interface that empowers
		investigators to execute state-of-the-art binary and multi-
		class classification, including deep learning, with minimal
		programming experience necessary.
