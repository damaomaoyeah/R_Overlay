		Simulation of Genomic Data in Applied Genetics // The package is
		intended for simulating high density genomic data. The meiosis
		is simulated under a count-location model, the genetic
		structure can include additive and dominance effects. The low
		level nature of the package provides great flexibility in
		creating all kinds of populations.
