		Data Sets from the History of Statistics and Data Visualization
		// The 'HistData' package provides a collection of small data
		sets that are interesting and important in the history of
		statistics and data visualization. The goal of the package is
		to make these available, both for instructional use and for
		historical research.  Some of these present interesting
		challenges for graphics or analysis in R.
