		Hive Plots of R Package Function Calls // Analyzes the function
		calls in an R package and creates a hive plot of the calls,
		dividing them among functions that only make outgoing calls
		(sources), functions that have only incoming calls (sinks), and
		those that have both incoming calls and make outgoing calls
		(managers).  Function calls can be mapped by their absolute
		numbers, their normalized absolute numbers, or their rank.
		FuncMap should be useful for comparing packages at a high level
		for their overall design.  Plus, it's just plain fun.  The hive
		plot concept was developed by Martin Krzywinski
		(www.hiveplot.com) and inspired this package.  Note: this
		package is maintained for historical reasons. HiveR is a full
		package for creating hive plots.
