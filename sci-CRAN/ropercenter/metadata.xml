		Reproducible Data Retrieval from the Roper Center Data Archive //
		Reproducible, programmatic retrieval of datasets from the Roper
		Center data archive.  The Roper Center for Public Opinion
		Research https://ropercenter.cornell.edu maintains the largest
		archive of public opinion data in existence, but researchers
		using these datasets are caught in a bind.  The Center's terms
		and conditions bar redistribution of downloaded datasets, but
		to ensure that one's work can be reproduced, assessed, and
		built upon by others, one must provide access to the raw data
		one employed.  The `ropercenter` package cuts this knot by
		providing registered users with programmatic, reproducible
		access to Roper Center datasets from within R.
