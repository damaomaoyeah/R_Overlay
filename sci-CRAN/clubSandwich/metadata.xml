		Cluster-Robust (Sandwich) Variance Estimators with Small-Sample
		Corrections // Provides several cluster-robust variance
		estimators (i.e., sandwich estimators) for ordinary and
		weighted least squares linear regression models. Several
		adjustments are incorporated to improve small- sample
		performance. The package includes functions for estimating the
		variance- covariance matrix and for testing single- and
		multiple-contrast hypotheses based on Wald test statistics.
		Tests of single regression coefficients use Satterthwaite or
		saddle-point corrections. Tests of multiple-contrast hypotheses
		use an approximation to Hotelling's T-squared distribution.
		Methods are provided for a variety of fitted models, including
		lm(), plm() (from package 'plm'), gls() and lme() (from
		'nlme'), robu() (from 'robumeta'), and rma.uni() and rma.mv()
		(from 'metafor').
