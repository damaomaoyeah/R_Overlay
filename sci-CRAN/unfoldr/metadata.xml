		Stereological Unfolding for Spheroidal Particles // Stereological
		unfolding as implemented in this package consists in the
		estimation of the joint size-shape-orientation distribution of
		spheroidal shaped particles based on the same measured
		quantities of corresponding planar section profiles. A single
		trivariate discretized version of the (stereological) integral
		equation in the case of prolate and oblate spheroids is solved
		numerically by the EM algorithm. The estimation of diameter
		distribution of spheres from planar sections (Wicksell's
		corpuscle problem) is also implemented. Further, the package
		provides routines for the simulation of a Poisson germ- grain
		process with either spheroids or spheres as grains together
		with functions for planar sections. For the purpose of exact
		simulation a bivariate size-shape distribution is implemented.
