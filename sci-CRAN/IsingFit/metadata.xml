		Fitting Ising models using the eLasso method // This network
		estimation procedure eLasso, which is based on the Ising model,
		combines l1-regularized logistic regression with model
		selection based on the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion
		(EBIC). EBIC is a fit measure that identifies relevant
		relationships between variables. The resulting network consists
		of variables as nodes and relevant relationships as edges. Can
		deal with binary data.
