		Analysis and Modeling for Geostatistical Count Data // This
		package provides a variety of functions to analyze and model
		geostatistical count data with generalized linear spatial
		models, including 1) simulate and visualize the data; 2)
		posterior sampling with robust MCMC algorithms (in serial or
		parallel way); 3) perform prediction for unsampled locations;
		4) conduct Bayesian model checking procedure to evaluate the
		goodness of fitting; 5) conduct transformed residual checking
		procedure. In the package, seamlessly embedded C++ programs and
		parallel computing techniques are implemented to speed up the
		computing processes.
