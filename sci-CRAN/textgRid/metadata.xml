		Praat TextGrid Objects in R // The software application Praat can
		be used to annotate waveform data (e.g., to mark intervals of
		interest or to label events). (See
		http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/ for more information about
		Praat.) These annotations are stored in a Praat TextGrid
		object, which consists of a number of interval tiers and point
		tiers. An interval tier consists of sequential (i.e., not
		overlapping) labeled intervals. A point tier consists of
		labeled events that have no duration. The 'textgRid' package
		provides S4 classes, generics, and methods for accessing
		information that is stored in Praat TextGrid objects.
