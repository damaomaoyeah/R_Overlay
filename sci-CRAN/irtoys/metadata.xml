		A Collection of Functions Related to Item Response Theory (IRT)
		// A collection of functions useful in learning and practicing
		IRT, which can be combined into larger programs. Provides basic
		CTT analysis, a simple common interface to the estimation of
		item parameters in IRT models for binary responses with three
		different programs (ICL, BILOG-MG, and ltm), ability estimation
		(MLE, BME, EAP, WLE, plausible values), item and person fit
		statistics, scaling methods (MM, MS, Stocking-Lord, and the
		complete Hebaera method), and a rich array of parametric and
		non-parametric (kernel) plots. Estimates and plots Haberman's
		interaction model when all items are dichotomously scored.
