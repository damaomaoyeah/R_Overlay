		Implementation of ELM (Extreme Learning Machine ) algorithm for
		SLFN ( Single Hidden Layer Feedforward Neural Networks ) //
		Training and predict functions for SLFN ( Single Hidden-layer
		Feedforward Neural Networks ) using the ELM algorithm. ELM
		algorithm differs from the traditional gradient-based
		algorithms for very short training times ( it doesn't need any
		iterative tuning, this makes learning time very fast ) and
		there is no need to set any other parameters like learning
		rate, momentum, epochs, etc.
