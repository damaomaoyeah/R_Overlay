		Fast Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection // An
		implementation of ADPclust clustering procedures (Fast
		Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection). The work is
		built and improved upon Rodriguez and Laio[2014]'s idea.
		ADPclust clusters data by finding density peaks in a density-
		distance plot generated from local multivariate Gaussian
		density estimation. It includes an automatic centroids
		selection and parameter optimization algorithm, which finds the
		number of clusters and cluster centroids by comparing average
		silhouettes on a grid of testing clustering results; It also
		includes an user interactive algorithm that allows the user to
		manually selects cluster centroids from a two dimensional
		"density-distance plot".
