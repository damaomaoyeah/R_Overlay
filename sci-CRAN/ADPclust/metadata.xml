		Fast Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection // An
		implementation of ADPclust clustering procedures (Fast
		Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection). The work is
		built and improved upon the idea of Rodriguez and Laio
		(2014)DOI:10.1126/science.1242072. ADPclust clusters data by
		finding density peaks in a density-distance plot generated from
		local multivariate Gaussian density estimation. It includes an
		automatic centroids selection and parameter optimization
		algorithm, which finds the number of clusters and cluster
		centroids by comparing average silhouettes on a grid of testing
		clustering results; It also includes a user interactive
		algorithm that allows the user to manually selects cluster
		centroids from a two dimensional "density-distance plot". Here
		is the research article associated with this package: "Wang,
		Xiao-Feng, and Yifan Xu (2015)DOI:10.1177/0962280215609948 Fast
