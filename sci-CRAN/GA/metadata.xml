		Genetic Algorithms // An R package for optimization using genetic
		algorithms. The package provides a flexible general-purpose set
		of tools for implementing genetic algorithms search in both the
		continuous and discrete case, whether constrained or not. Users
		can easily define their own objective function depending on the
		problem at hand. Several genetic operators are available and
		can be combined to explore the best settings for the current
		task. Furthermore, users can define new genetic operators and
		easily evaluate their performances. GAs can be run sequentially
		or in parallel.
