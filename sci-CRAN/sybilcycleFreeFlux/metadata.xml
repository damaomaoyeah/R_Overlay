		cycle-Free Flux balance analysis: Efficient removal of
		thermodynamically infeasible cycles from metabolic flux
		distributions // implement cycle-Free flux balance analysis,
		flux variability, and Random Sampling of solution space. Flux
		balance analysis is a technique to find fluxes in metabolic
		models at steady state. It is described in Orth, J.D., Thiele,
		I. and Palsson, B.O. What is flux balance analysis? Nat.
		Biotech. 28, 245-248 (2010).
