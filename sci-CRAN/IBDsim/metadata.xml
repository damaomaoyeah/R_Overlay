		Simulation of Chromosomal Regions Shared by Family Members // R
		package for simulation of IBD sharing among family members.
		Using sex specific recombination rates from the Decode map
		(2010) of the human genome, phased chromosomes are simulated
		for all pedigree members, either by unconditional 'gene
		dropping' or conditional on a specified IBD pattern. Regions
		compatible with the query IBD pattern (possibly different from
		the conditional pattern) are subsequently detected and
		summarized.
