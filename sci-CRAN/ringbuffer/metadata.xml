		Ring buffer (circular buffer) data structure // A circular
		buffer, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that
		uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-
		to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data
		streams.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_buffer for more
		information.
