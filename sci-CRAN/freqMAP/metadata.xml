		Frequency Moving Average Plots (MAP) of Multinomial Data by a
		Continuous Covariate // A frequency moving average plot (MAP)
		is estimated from a multinomial data and a continuous
		covariate. The frequency MAP is a moving average estimate of
		category frequencies, where frequency means and posterior
		bounds are estimated. Comparisons of two frequency MAPs as well
		as odds ratios can be plotted.
