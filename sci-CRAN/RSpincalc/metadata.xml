		Package for converting between attitude representations: DCM,
		Euler angles, Quaternions, and Euler vectors. // A package for
		converting between attitude representations: DCM, Euler angles,
		Quaternions, and Euler vectors. Plus conversion between 2 Euler
		angle set types (xyx, yzy, zxz, xzx, yxy, zyz, xyz, yzx, zxy,
		xzy, yxz, zyx). Fully vectorized code, with warnings/errors for
		Euler angles (singularity, out of range, invalid angle order),
		DCM (orthogonality, not proper, exceeded tolerance to unity
		determinant) and Euler vectors(not unity). Also quaternion and
		other useful functions. Based on SpinCalc by John Fuller and
		SpinConv by Paolo de Leva.
