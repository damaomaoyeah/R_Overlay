		Estimate and Account for Tumor Purity in Cancer Methylation Data
		Analysis // The proportion of cancer cells in solid tumor
		sample, known as the tumor purity, has adverse impact on a
		variety of data analyses if not properly accounted for. We
		develop 'InfiniumPurify', which is a comprehensive R package
		for estimating and accounting for tumor purity based on DNA
		methylation Infinium 450k array data. 'InfiniumPurify' provides
		functionalities for tumor purity estimation. In addition, it
		can perform differential methylation detection and tumor sample
		clustering with the consideration of tumor purities.
