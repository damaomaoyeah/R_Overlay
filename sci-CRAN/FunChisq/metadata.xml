		Chi-Square and Exact Tests for Non-Parametric Functional
		Dependencies // Statistical hypothesis testing methods for non-
		parametric functional dependencies based on asymptotic chi-
		square and exact statistics. These tests were designed to
		reveal causality based on evidence from functional
		dependencies. They include an asymptotic non-constant
		functional chi-square test, an exact functional test, and a
		comparative functional chi-square test. The normalized
		functional chi-square test was used by the Best Performer
		NMSUSongLab in DREAM8 Breast Cancer Network Inference
		Challenges. These tests offer an advantage over regression
		analysis when a parametric functional form cannot be assumed.
