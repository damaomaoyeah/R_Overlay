		Chi-Square and Exact Tests for Non-Parametric Functional
		Dependencies // Statistical hypothesis testing methods for non-
		parametric functional dependencies using asymptotic chi-square
		or exact statistics. These tests were motivated to reveal
		evidence for causality based on functional dependencies. They
		include asymptotic functional chi-square tests, an exact
		functional test, a comparative functional chi-square test, and
		also a comparative chi-square test. The normalized non-constant
		functional chi-square test was used by Best Performer
		NMSUSongLab in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network
		Inference Challenges. These tests offer an advantage over
		regression analysis when a parametric functional form cannot be
		assumed.
