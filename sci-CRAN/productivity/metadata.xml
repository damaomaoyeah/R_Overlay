		Indices of Productivity Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) //
		Various transitive measures of productivity and profitability,
		in levels and changes, are computed. In addition to the classic
		Malmquist productivity index, the 'productivity' package
		contains also the multiplicatively complete and transitive Fre-
		Primont and Lowe indices. These indices are also decomposed
		into different components providing insightful information on
		the sources of productivity and profitability improvements. In
		the use of Malmquist productivity index, the technological
		change index is further decomposed into bias technological
		change components. For the transitive Fre-Primont and Lowe
		measures, it is possible to rule out technological change. The
		package also allows to prohibit negative technological change.
		All the estimations are based on the nonparametric Data
		Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and several assumptions regarding
		returns to scale are available (i.e. CRS, VRS, NIRS, NDRS). The
		package allows parallel computing by default, depending on the
		user's computer configuration.
