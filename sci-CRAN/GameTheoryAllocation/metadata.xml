		Tools for Calculating Allocations in Game Theory // Many
		situations can be modeled as game theoretic situations. Some
		procedures are included in this package to calculate the most
		important allocations rules in Game Theory: Shapley value, Owen
		value or nucleolus, among other. First, we must define as an
		argument the value of the unions of the envolved agents with
		the characteristic function.
