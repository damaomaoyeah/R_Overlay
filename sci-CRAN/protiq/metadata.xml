		Protein (identification and) quantification based on peptide
		evidence // Method for protein quantification based on
		identified and quantified peptides. protiq can be used for
		absolute and relative protein quantification. Input peptide
		abundance scores can come from various sources, including SRM
		transition areas and intensities or spectral counts derived
		from shotgun experiments. The package is still being extended
		to also include the model for protein identification, MIPGEM,
		presented in Gerster, S., Qeli, E., Ahrens, C.H. and Buehlmann,
		P. (2010). Protein and gene model inference based on
		statistical modeling in k-partite graphs. Proceedings of the
		National Academy of Sciences 107(27):12101-12106.
