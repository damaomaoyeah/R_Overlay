		Select Sparse Geoadditive Models for Spatial Prediction // A
		model building procedure to select a sparse geoadditive model
		from a large number of covariates. Continuous, binary and
		ordered categorical responses are supported. The model building
		is based on component wise gradient boosting with linear
		effects and smoothing splines. The resulting covariate set
		after gradient boosting is further reduced through cross
		validated backward selection and aggregation of factor levels.
		The package provides a model based bootstrap method to simulate
		prediction intervals for point predictions. A test data set of
		a soil mapping case study is provided.
