		'Htmlwidgets' in Responsive 'iframes' // Provides two functions
		'frameableWidget()', and 'frameWidget()'. The
		'frameableWidget()' is used to add extra code to a 'htmlwidget'
		which allows is to be rendered correctly inside a responsive
		'iframe'. The 'frameWidget()' is a 'htmlwidget' which displays
		content of another 'htmlwidget' inside a responsive 'iframe'.
		These functions allow for easier embedding of 'htmlwidgets' in
		content management systems such as 'wordpress', 'blogger' etc.
		They also allow for separation of widget content from main HTML
		content where CSS of the main HTML could interfere with the
		widget.
