		Analytic Solutions for (ground-water) Boussinesq Equation // This
		package is a collection of R functions implemented from
		published and available analytic solutions for the One-
		Dimensional Boussinesq Equation (ground-water). In particular,
		the function "beq.lin" is the analytic solution of the
		linearized form of Boussinesq Equation between two different
		head-based boundary (Dirichlet) conditions; "beq.song" is the
		non-linear power-series analytic solution of the motion of a
		wetting front over a dry bedrock (Song at al, 2007, see
		complete reference on function documentation).
		Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are warmly
		welcomed.
