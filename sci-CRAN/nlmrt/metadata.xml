		Functions for Nonlinear Least Squares Solutions // nlmrt provides
		tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems using a
		calling structure similar to, but much simpler than, that of
		the nls() function. Moreover, where nls() specifically does NOT
		deal with small or zero residual problems, nlmrt is quite happy
		to solve them. It also attempts to be more robust in finding
		solutions, thereby avoiding 'singular gradient' messages that
		arise in the Gauss-Newton method within nls(). The Marquardt-
		Nash approach in nlmrt generally works more reliably to get a
		solution, though this solution may be one of a set of
		possibilities, and may also be statistically unsatisfactory.
		Because of the intended aggressive policy to find solutions,
		the approach may use additional and unnecessary function and
		Jacobian evaluations. Note that the Jacobian function is
		developed using analytic expressions rather than numerical
		approximations if this is possible. Added print and summary as
		of August 28, 2012.
