		Discrimination of Alternative Reproductive Tactics (ARTs). //
		'discrimARTs' discriminates with explicit confidence the
		alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in dimorphic systems
		with bimodal traits by computing the maximum likelihood
		estimate of a mixture of distributions of a measured ARTs
		trait. Supported distributions include a mixture of 2 normal
		distributions and a mixture of 2 facing gamma distributions.
