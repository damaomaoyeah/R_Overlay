		Dynamic Modeling in R // Dynamic modeling of all kinds in R.
		These include models of processes in discrete time or
		continuous time. They also include processes that are linear or
		nonlinear. Latent variables can be continuous (e.g. state space
		models) or discrete (e.g. regime-switching models). The general
		approach involves maximum likelihood estimation of single- and
		multi-subject models of latent time series with the extended
		Kalman filter and Kim filter. The user provides recipes and
		data which are combined into a model that is then cooked to
		obtain free parameter estimates.
