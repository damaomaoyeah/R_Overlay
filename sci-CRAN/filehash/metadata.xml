		Simple Key-Value Database // Implements a simple key-value style
		database where character string keys are associated with data
		values that are stored on the disk. A simple interface is
		provided for inserting, retrieving, and deleting data from the
		database. Utilities are provided that allow 'filehash'
		databases to be treated much like environments and lists are
		already used in R. These utilities are provided to encourage
		interactive and exploratory analysis on large datasets. Three
		different file formats for representing the database are
		currently available and new formats can easily be incorporated
		by third parties for use in the 'filehash' framework.
