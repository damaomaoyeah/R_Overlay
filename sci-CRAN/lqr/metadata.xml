		Robust Linear Quantile Regression // It fits a robust linear
		quantile regression model using a new family of zero-quantile
		distributions for the error term. This family of distribution
		includes skewed versions of the Normal, Student's t, Laplace,
		Slash and Contaminated Normal distribution. It provides
		estimates and full inference. It also provides envelopes plots
		for assessing the fit and confidences bands when several
		quantiles are provided simultaneously.
