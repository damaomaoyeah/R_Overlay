		Node Harvest for Regression and Classification // Node harvest is
		a simple interpretable tree-like estimator for high-dimensional
		regression and classification. A few nodes are selected from an
		initially large ensemble of nodes, each associated with a
		positive weight. New observations can fall into one or several
		nodes and predictions are the weighted average response across
		all these groups. The package offers visualization of the
		estimator. Predictions can return the nodes a new observation
		fell into, along with the mean response of training
		observations in each node, offering a simple explanation of the
		prediction.
