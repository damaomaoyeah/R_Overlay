		Weighted k-Means Clustering // Entropy weighted k-means (ewkm) is
		a weighted subspace clustering algorithm that is well suited to
		very high dimensional data. Weights are calculated as the
		importance of a variable with regard to cluster membership.
		The two-level variable weighting clustering algorithm
		tw-k-means (twkm) introduces two types of weights, the weights
		on individual variables and the weights on variable groups, and
		they are calculated during the clustering process.  The feature
		group weighted k-means (fgkm) extends this concept by grouping
		features and weighting the group in addition to weighting
		individual features.
