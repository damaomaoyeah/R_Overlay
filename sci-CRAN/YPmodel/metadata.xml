		The Short-term and Long-term Hazard Ratio Model for Survival Data
		// This package contains various inference procedures
		associated with a two-sample semi-parametric model that can
		accommodate a flexible range of hazard ratio patterns. This
		model contains the proportional hazards model and the
		proportional odds model as sub-models, and accommodates non-
		proportional hazards situations to the extreme of having
		crossing hazards and crossing survivor functions. Overall, this
		package has four major functions: 1) the parameter estimation,
		namely short-term and long-term hazard ratio parameters; 2) 95
		percent and 90 percent point-wise confidence intervals and
		simultaneous confidence bands for the hazard ratio function; 3)
		p-value of the adaptive weighted log-rank test; 4) p-values of
		two lack-of-fit tests for the model. See the included
		"read_me_first.pdf" for brief instructions. In this version
		(1.1), there is no need to sort the data before applying this
		package.
