		Optimal Power Space Transformation // Comparison of data by
		Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients is prone to
		outliers. The problem can be alleviated by normalizing data
		with outliers before computing the Pearson correlation
		coefficient. The sample provides such normalization by optimal
		power space transformation.
