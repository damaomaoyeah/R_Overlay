		Patient Subgroup Identification for Clinical Drug Development //
		Function Wrapper contains four algorithms for developing
		threshold-based multivariate (prognostic/predictive) biomarker
		signatures via bootstrapping and aggregating of thresholds from
		trees, Monte-Carlo variations of the Adaptive Indexing method
		and Patient Rule Induction Method. Variable selection is
		automatically built-in to these algorithms. Final signatures
		are returned with interaction plots for predictive signatures.
		Cross-validation performance evaluation and testing dataset
		results are also output.
