		R Package for Fitting Multinomial Probit Models with Endogenous
		Selection // endogMNP is an R package that fits a Bayesian
		multinomial probit model with endogenous selection, which is
		sometimes called an endogenous switching model.  This can be
		used to model discrete choice data when respondents select
		themselves into one of several groups.  This package is based
		on the MNP package by Kosuke Imai and David A. van Dyk.  This
		package modifies their code.
