		Interface for the 'Box.com API' // An R interface for the remote
		file hosting service 'Box' (https://www.box.com/). In addition
		to uploading and downloading files, this package includes
		functions which mirror base R operations for local files, (e.g.
		box_load(), box_save(), box_read(), box_setwd(), etc.), as well
		as 'git' style functions for entire directories (e.g.
		box_fetch(), box_push()).
