		Bayesian Variant Selection: Bayesian Model Uncertainty Techniques
		for Genetic Association Studies // The functions in this
		package focus on analyzing case-control association studies
		involving a group of genetic variants.  In particular, we are
		interested in modeling the outcome variable as a function of a
		multivariate genetic profile using Bayesian model uncertainty
		and variable selection techniques.  The package incorporates
		functions to analyze data sets involving common variants as
		well as extensions to model rare variants via the Bayesian Risk
		Index (BRI) as well as haplotypes.  Finally, the package also
		allows the incorporation of external biological information to
		inform the marginal inclusion probabilities via the iBMU.
