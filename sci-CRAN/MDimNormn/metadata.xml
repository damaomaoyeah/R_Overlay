		Multi-Dimensional MA Normalization for Plate Effect // Normalize
		data to minimize the difference between sample plates (batch
		effects). For given data in a matrix and grouping variable (or
		plate), the function 'normn_MA' normalizes the data on MA
		coordinates. More details are in the citation. The primary
		method is 'Multi-MA'. Other fitting functions on MA coordinates
		can also be employed e.g. loess.
