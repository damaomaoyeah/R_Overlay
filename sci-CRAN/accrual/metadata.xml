		Bayesian Accrual Prediction // Subject recruitment for medical
		research is challenging. Slow patient accrual leads to delay in
		research. Accrual monitoring during the process of recruitment
		is critical. Researchers need reliable tools to manage the
		accrual rate. We developed a Bayesian method that integrates
		researcher's experience on previous trials and data from the
		current study, providing reliable prediction on accrual rate
		for clinical studies. In this R package, we present functions
		for Bayesian accrual prediction which can be easily used by
		statisticians and clinical researchers.
