		Supervised Raster Image Classification // This package contains
		functions to perform supervised and pixel based raster image
		classification. It has been designed to facilitate land-cover
		analysis. Five classification algorithms can be used: Maximum
		Likelihood Classification, Multinomial Logistic Regression,
		Neural Networks, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines.
		The output includes the classified raster and standard
		classification accuracy assessment such as the accuracy matrix,
		the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient. An option for
		in-sample verification is available.
