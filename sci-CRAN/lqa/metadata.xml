		Penalized Likelihood Inference for GLMs // This package provides
		some basic infrastructure and tools to fit Generalized Linear
		Models (GLMs) via penalized likelihood inference. Estimating
		procedures already implemented are the LQA algorithm (that is
		where its name come from), P-IRLS, RidgeBoost, GBlockBoost and
		ForwardBoost.
