		Phenotypic Integration Index // Provides functions to estimate
		the size-controlled phenotypic integration index, a novel
		method by Torices  Mndez (2014) to solve problems due to
		individual size when estimating integration (namely, larger
		individuals have larger components, which will drive a
		correlation between components only due to resource
		availability that might obscure the observed measures of
		integration). In addition, the package also provides the
		classical estimation by Wagner (1984), bootstrapping and
		jackknife methods to calculate confidence intervals and a
		significance test for both integration indices.
