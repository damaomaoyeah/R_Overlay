		Manipulate and Visualize VCF Data // Facilitates easy
		manipulation of variant call format (VCF) data. Functions are
		provided to rapidly read from and write to VCF files. Once VCF
		data is read into R a parser function extracts matrices of
		data. This information can then be used for quality control or
		other purposes. Additional functions provide visualization of
		genomic data. Once processing is complete data may be written
		to a VCF file (*.vcf.gz). It also may be converted into other
		popular R objects (e.g., genlight, DNAbin). VcfR provides a
		link between VCF data and familiar R software.
