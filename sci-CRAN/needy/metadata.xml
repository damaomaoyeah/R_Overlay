		needy // needy is a small utility library designed to make
		testing function inputs less difficult. R is a dynamically
		typed language, but larger projects need input checking for
		scalabity. needy offers a single function, require_a( ), which
		lets you specify the traits an input object should have, such
		as class, size, numerical properties or number of parameters,
		while reducing boilerplate code and aiding debugging.
