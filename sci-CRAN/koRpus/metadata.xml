		An R Package for Text Analysis // A set of tools to analyze
		texts. Includes, amongst others, functions for automatic
		language detection, hyphenation, several indices of lexical
		diversity (e.g., type token ratio, HD-D/vocd-D, MTLD) and
		readability (e.g., Flesch, SMOG, LIX, Dale-Chall). Basic import
		functions for language corpora are also provided, to enable
		frequency analyses (supports Celex and Leipzig Corpora
		Collection file formats) and measures like tf-idf.  #' Note:
		For full functionality a local installation of TreeTagger is
		recommended. koRpus also includes a plugin for the R GUI and
		IDE RKWard, providing dialogs for its basic features. To use
		them, install RKWard from http://rkward.sf.net (plugins are
		detected automatically). Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the
		full package sources are only available from the project
		homepage.
