		Function Errorizer // Provides a function to convert existing R
		functions into "errorized" versions with added logging and
		handling functionality when encountering errors or warnings.
		The errorize function accepts an existing R function as its
		first argument and returns a R function with the exact same
		arguments and functionality. However, if an error or warning
		occurs when running that "errorized" R function, it will save a
		.Rds file to the current working directory with the relevant
		objects and information required to immediately recreate the
		error.
