		Functions for re-sampling a community matrix to compute diversity
		indices at different sampling levels. // There are two
		functions in this package, which can be used together to
		estimate the Shannon's Diversity index at different levels of
		sample size. A Monte-Carlo procedure is used to re-sample a
		given observation at each level of sampling. The expectation
		being that the mean of the re-sampling will approach Shannon's
		diversity index at that sample level.
