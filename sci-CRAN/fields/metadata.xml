		Tools for Spatial Data // For curve, surface and function fitting
		with an emphasis on splines, spatial data and spatial
		statistics. The major methods include cubic, and thin plate
		splines, Kriging and compact covariances for large data sets.
		The splines and Kriging methods are supporting by functions
		that can determine the smoothing parameter (nugget and sill
		variance) by cross validation and also by restricted maximum
		likelihood. For Kriging there is an easy to function that also
		estimates the correlation scale (range). A major feature is
		that any covariance function implemented in R and following a
		simple fields format can be used for spatial prediction. There
		are also many useful functions for plotting and working with
		spatial data as images. This package also contains an
		implementation of sparse matrix methods for large spatial data
		sets and currently requires the sparse matrix (spam) package.
		Use help(fields) to get started and for an overview.  The
		fields source code is deliberately commented and provides
		useful explanations of numerical details in addition to the
		manual pages. The commented source code can be viewed by
		expanding the source code .tar.gz file and looking in R
		subdirectory.
