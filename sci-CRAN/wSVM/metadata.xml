		Weighted SVM with boosting algorithm for improving accuracy // We
		propose weighted SVM methods with penalization form. By adding
		weights to loss term, we can build up weighted SVM easily and
		examine classification algorithm properties under weighted SVM.
		Through comparing each of test error rates, we conclude that
		our Weighted SVM with boosting has predominant properties than
		the standard SVM have, as a whole.
