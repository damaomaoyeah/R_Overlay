		Estimate diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, etc) and
		agreement statistics when one test is conducted on only a
		subsample of specimens // A standard test is observed on all
		specimens.  We treat the second test (or sampled test) as being
		conducted on only a stratified sample of specimens.  We treat
		the total sample as stratified two-phase sampling and use
		inverse probability weighting.  We estimate diagnostic accuracy
		(category-specific classification probabilities; for binary
		tests reduces to specificity and sensitivity) and agreement
		statistics (percent agreement, percent agreement by category,
		Kappa (unweighted), and symmetry tests (reduces to McNemar's
		test for binary tests)).
