		Piecewise Constant Hazards Models for Censored and Truncated Data
		// Using piecewise constant hazards models is a very flexible
		approach for the analysis of survival data. The time line is
		divided into sub-intervals; for each interval, a different
		hazard is estimated using Poisson regression.
