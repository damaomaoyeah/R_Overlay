		Block Diagonal Extraction or Replacement // Several tools for
		handling block-matrix diagonals and similar constructs are
		implemented. Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or
		removed using two small functions implemented here. In
		addition, non-square matrices are supported. Block diagonal
		matrices occur when two dimensions of a data set are combined
		along one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the
		'decompr' and 'gvc' packages have each country-industry
		combination occur along both edges of the matrix.
