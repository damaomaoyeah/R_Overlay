		A collection of methods for left-censored missing data imputation
		// The package contains a collection of functions for left-
		censored missing data imputation. Left-censoring is a special
		case of missing not at random (MNAR)  mechanism that generates
		non-responses in proteomics experiments. The package also
		contains functions to artificially generate peptide/protein
		expression data (log-transformed) as random draws from a
		multivariate Gaussian distribution as well as a function to
		generate missing data (both randomly and non-randomly). For
		comparison reasons, the package also contains several wrapper
		functions for the imputation of non-responses that are missing
		at random. * New functionality has been added: a hybrid method
		that allows the imputation of missing values in a more complex
		scenario where the missing data are both MAR and MNAR.
