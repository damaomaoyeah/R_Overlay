		Differential Exon Usage Test for RNA-Seq Data via Empirical Bayes
		Shrinkage of the Dispersion Parameter // Differential exon
		usage test for RNA-Seq data via an empirical Bayes shrinkage
		method for the dispersion parameter the utilizes inclusion-
		exclusion data to analyze the propensity to skip an exon across
		groups. The input data consists of two matrices where each row
		represents an exon and the columns represent the biological
		samples. The first matrix is the count of the number of reads
		expressing the exon for each sample. The second matrix is the
		count of the number of reads that either express the exon or
		explicitly skip the exon across the samples, a.k.a. the total
		count matrix. Dividing the two matrices yields proportions
		representing the propensity to express the exon versus skipping
		the exon for each sample.
