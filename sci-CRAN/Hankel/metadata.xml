		Univariate non-parametric two-sample test based on empirical
		Hankel transforms. // Provides an R routine for a Cramer-von
		Mises type two sample test which is based on empirical Hankel
		transforms of the non-negative sample variables. The test is
		non-parametric and not distribution free. The exact value of
		the test statistic for univariate data as well as the p-value
		and the critical value are computed.
