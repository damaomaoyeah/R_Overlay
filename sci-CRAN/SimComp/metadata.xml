		Simultaneous Comparisons for Multiple Endpoints // Simultaneous
		tests and confidence intervals are provided for one-way
		experimental designs with one or many normally distributed,
		primary response variables (endpoints). Differences (Hasler and
		Hothorn, 2011) or ratios (Hasler and Hothorn, 2012) of means
		can be considered. Various contrasts can be chosen, unbalanced
		sample sizes are allowed as well as heterogeneous variances
		(Hasler and Hothorn, 2008) or covariance matrices (Hasler,
		2014).
