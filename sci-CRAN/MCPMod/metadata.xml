		Design and Analysis of Dose-Finding Studies (see also DoseFinding
		package) // This package implements a methodology for the
		design and analysis of dose-response studies that combines
		aspects of multiple comparison procedures and modeling
		approaches (Bretz, Pinheiro and Branson, 2005, Biometrics 61,
		738-748). The package provides tools for the analysis of dose
		finding trials as well as a variety of tools necessary to plan
		a trial to be conducted with the MCPMod methodology. ***NOTE***
		The MCPMod package will not be further developed, all future
		development of the MCP-Mod methodology will be done in the
