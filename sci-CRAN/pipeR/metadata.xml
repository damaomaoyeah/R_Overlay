		Multi-Paradigm Pipeline Implementation // Provides various styles
		of function chaining methods: Pipe operator, Pipe object, and
		pipeline function, each representing a distinct pipeline model
		yet sharing almost a common set of features: A value can be
		piped to the first unnamed argument of a function and to dot
		symbol in an enclosed expression. The syntax is designed to
		make the pipeline more readable and friendly to a wide range of
		operations.
