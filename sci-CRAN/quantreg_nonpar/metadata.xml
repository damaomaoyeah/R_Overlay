		Nonparametric Series Quantile Regression // Implements the
		nonparametric quantile regression method developed by Belloni,
		Chernozhukov, and Fernandez-Val (2011) to partially linear
		quantile models. Provides point estimates of the conditional
		quantile function and its derivatives based on series
		approximations to the nonparametric part of the model. Provides
		pointwise and uniform confidence intervals using analytic and
		resampling methods.
