		Unified Handling of Graphics Devices // Functions for creating
		plots and image files in a unified way regardless of output
		format (EPS, PDF, PNG, SVG, TIFF, WMF, etc.).  Default device
		options as well as scales and aspect ratios are controlled in a
		uniform way across all device types.  Switching output format
		requires minimal changes in code.  This package is ideal for
		large-scale batch processing, because it will never leave open
		graphics devices or incomplete image files behind, even on
		errors or user interrupts.
