		Lightweight Sparklines for a LaTeX Document // Sparklines are
		small plots (about one line of text high), made popular by
		Edward Tufte.  This package is the interface from R to the
		LaTeX package sparklines by Andreas Loeffer and Dan Luecking
		(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/sparklines).  It can work with Sweave
		or knitr or other engines that produce TeX.  The package can be
		used to plot vectors, matrices, data frames, time series (in ts
		or zoo format).
