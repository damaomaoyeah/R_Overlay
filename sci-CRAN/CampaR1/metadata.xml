		Trajectory Analysis // Analysis algorithms extracted from the
		original 'campari' software package. They consists in a kinetic
		annotation of the trajectory based on the minimum spanning tree
		constructed on the distances between snapshots. The fast
		algorithm is implemented on the basis of a modified version of
		the birch algorithm, while the slow one is based on a simple
		leader clustering. For more information please visit the
		original documentation on
		http://campari.sourceforge.net/index.html.
