		Set of common tools for model diagnostics. // Set of tools to
		assess the performance of a model through the computation of
		typical prediction scores against one or more observational
		datasets or reanalyses (a reanalysis being a physical
		extrapolation of observations that relies on the equations from
		a model, not a pure observational dataset).
