		Cut Numeric Values into Evenly Distributed Groups //
		Implementation of algorithms for cutting numerical values
		exhibiting a potentially highly skewed distribution into evenly
		distributed groups (bins). This functionality can be applied
		for binning discrete values, such as counts, as well as for
		discretization of continuous values, for example, during
		generation of features used in machine learning algorithms.
