		Degrees of freedom of elastic net, adaptive lasso and generalized
		elastic net // This package computes the degrees of freedom of
		the lasso, elastic net, generalized elastic net and adaptive
		lasso based on the generalized path seeking algorithm.  The
		optimal model can be selected by model selection criteria
		including Mallows' Cp, bias-corrected AIC (AICc), generalized
		cross validation (GCV) and BIC.
