		Generalized Linear Mixed Models using Template Model Builder //
		Fit linear and generalized linear mixed models with various
		extensions, including zero-inflation. The models are fitted
		using maximum likelihood estimation via 'TMB' (Template Model
		Builder). Random effects are assumed to be Gaussian on the
		scale of the linear predictor and are integrated out using the
		Laplace approximation. Gradients are calculated using automatic
		differentiation.
