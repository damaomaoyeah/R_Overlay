		Two-Group Straight Line ANCOVA // Provides directly interpretable
		estimated coefficients for four models in connection with the
		two-group straight line ANCOVA problem: (A) the full model,
		which requires the fitting of two intercepts and two slopes;
		(B) a reduced model, which requires the fitting of a single
		intercept and single slope; (C) a reduced model, which requires
		the fitting of two separate intercepts and a single, common
		slope; and (D) a reduced model, which requires the fitting of a
		single, common intercept and two separate slopes.  The summary
		function provides tests of fit for the (null) hypotheses of:
		(1) equivalent data sets, (2) equivalent slopes, and (3)
		equivalent intercepts.
