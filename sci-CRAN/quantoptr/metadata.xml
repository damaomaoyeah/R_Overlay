		Algorithms for Quantile- And Mean-Optimal Treatment Regimes //
		Estimation methods for optimal treatment regimes under three
		different criteria, namely marginal quantile, marginal mean,
		and mean absolute difference. For the first two criteria, both
		one-stage and two-stage estimation method are implemented. A
		doubly robust estimator for estimating the quantile-optimal
		treatment regime is also included.
