		Gradient Boosting // Functional gradient descent algorithm for a
		variety of convex and nonconvex loss functions, for both
		classical and robust regression and classification problems.
		HingeBoost is implemented for binary and multi-class
		classification, with unequal misclassification costs for binary
		case. The algorithm can fit linear and nonlinear classifiers.
