		Nonparametric Estimation of Preferential Attachment and Node
		Fitness in Temporal Complex Networks // A statistically sound
		method for estimating jointly the attachment function and node
		fitness in a temporal complex network by maximizing a suitable
		penalized log-likelihood function is implemented in this
		package. Tutorial can be found in the accompanying vignette.
		More details about the method can be found at
		http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137796. To cite this
		package in your projects, please run the command:
		citation("PAFit") for a list of references you should cite.
