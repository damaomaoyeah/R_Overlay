		Nonparametric Estimation of Preferential Attachment and Node
		Fitness in Temporal Complex Networks // A statistically sound
		method for estimating jointly the attachment function and node
		fitness in a temporal complex network by maximizing a suitable
		penalized log-likelihood function is implemented in this
		package. Tutorial can be found in the accompanying vignette.
