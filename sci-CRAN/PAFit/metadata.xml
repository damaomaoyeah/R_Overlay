		Joint Inference of Preferential Attachment and Node Fitness in
		Temporal Complex Networks // A framework for modelling and
		inferencing the attachment mechanisms of temporal complex
		networks is implemented in this package. For estimating the
		preferential attachment (PA) function in isolation, we
		implement Jeong's method, the corrected Newman's method and the
		PAFit method. For jointly estimating the PA function and node
		fitnesses, we implement the PAFit method. The package also
		provides flexible methods to generate a wide range of temporal
		networks based on PA and fitness.
