		General Bivariate Copula Theory and Many Utility Functions //
		Extensive functions for bivariate copula (bicopula)
		computations and related mathematical operations oriented
		around the oft cited and fundamental bicopula theory described
		by Nelsen (2006), Joe (2014), and other selected works. The
		lower, upper, product, and a few select other bicopula are
		implemented. Individual copula support is deliberately limited
		to keep the package focused on an educational API to major
		bicopula theory. Expressions for an arbitrary bicopula include
		the diagonal, survival copula, the dual of a copula, co-copula,
		and numerical bicopula density. Level curves (sets) as well as
		horizontal and vertical sections and derivatives of such
		sections also are supported. The numerical derivatives of a
		bicopula are provided as well as inverses; simulation by the
		conditional distribution method thus are supported.
		Composition, convex combination, and products of bicopula are
		provided.  Copula properties include Kendall Function and
		L-moments thereof, Kendall Tau, Spearman Rho and Footrule, Gini
		Gamma, Blomqvist Beta, Hoeffding Phi, Schweizer-Wolff Sigma,
		tail dependency and order, and skewness. Evaluators of
		positively/negatively quadrant dependency, left-tail
		decreasing, and right-tail increasing are available. Kullback-
		Leibler divergence, Vuong's procedure, and L-comoments for
		copula inference are available. Quantile and median regressions
		for V with respect to U and U with respect to V are available.
		Empirical copulas (EC) are supported.
