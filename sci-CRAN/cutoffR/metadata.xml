		CUTOFF: A Spatio-temporal Imputation Method // This package
		provides a set of tools for spatio-temporal imputation in R. It
		includes the implementation for then CUTOFF imputation method,
		a useful cross-validation function that can be used not only by
		the CUOTFF method but also by some other imputation  functions
		to help choosing an optimal value for relevant parameters, such
		as the number of k-nearest neighbors for the KNN imputation
		method, or the number of components for the SVD imputation
		method. It also contains tools for simulating data with missing
		values with respect to some specific missing pattern, for
		example, block missing. Some useful visualisation functions for
		imputation purposes are also provided in the package.
