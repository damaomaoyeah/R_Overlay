		Efficient Estimation of Discrete-Time Multivariate Frailty Model
		Using Exact Likelihood Function for Grouped Survival Data //
		The core of this 'Rcpp' based package is several functions to
		compute the baseline hazard, effect parameter, and frailty
		variance for the discrete-time shared frailty model with random
		effects. The core functions include two processes: (1) evaluate
		the multiple variable integration to compute the exact
		proportional hazards model based likelihood and (2) estimate
		desired parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. The
		integration is evaluated by 'Cuhre' function from 'Cuba'
		library (Hahn, T., Cuba-a library for multidimensional
		numerical integration, Comput. Phys. Commun. 168, 2005, 78-95
		doi: 10.1016/j.cpc.2005.01.010), and the source files of
		'Cuhre' function are included in this package. Maximization
		process is carried out using the Brent's algorithm, and the 'C+
		+' code file is from John Burkardt and John Denker (Brent,
		R.,Algorithms for Minimization without Derivatives, Dover,
		2002, ISBN 0-486-41998-3).
