		Export R Output to LaTeX or HTML // Export Rcmdr output to LaTeX
		or HTML code. The plug-in was originally intended to facilitate
		exporting Rcmdr output to formats other than ASCII text and to
		provide R novices with an easy-to-use, easy-to-access reference
		on exporting R objects to formats suited for printed output.
		The package documentation contains several pointers on creating
		reports, either by using conventional word processors or
		LaTeX/LyX.
