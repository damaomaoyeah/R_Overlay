		Estimation of the Number of Fatalities from Carcass Searches //
		The number of bird or bat fatalities from collisions with
		buildings, towers or wind energy turbines can be estimated
		based on carcass searches and experimentally assessed carcass
		persistence times and searcher efficiency. Functions for
		estimating the probability that a bird or bat that died is
		found by a searcher are provided. Further functions calculate
		the posterior distribution of the number of fatalities based on
		the number of carcasses found and the estimated detection
		probability.
