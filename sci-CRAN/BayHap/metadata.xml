		Bayesian analysis of haplotype association using Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo // The package BayHap performs simultaneous
		estimation of uncertain haplotype frequencies and association
		with haplotypes based on generalized linear models for
		quantitative, binary and survival traits. Bayesian statistics
		and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques are the theoretical
		framework for the methods of estimation included in this
		package. Prior values for model parameters can be included by
		the user. Convergence diagnostics and statistical and graphical
		analysis of the sampling output can be also carried out.
