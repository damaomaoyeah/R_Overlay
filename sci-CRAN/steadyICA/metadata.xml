		ICA and Tests of Independence via Multivariate Distance
		Covariance // Functions related to multivariate measures of
		independence and ICA: -estimate independent components by
		minimizing distance covariance; -conduct a test of mutual
		independence based on distance covariance; -estimate
		independent components via infomax (a popular method but
		generally performs poorer than mdcovica, ProDenICA, and/or
		fastICA, but is useful for comparisons); -order indepedent
		components by skewness; -match independent components from
		multiple estimates; -other functions useful in ICA.
