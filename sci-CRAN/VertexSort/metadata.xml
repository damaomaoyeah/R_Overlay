		Network Hierarchical Structure and Randomization // Permits to
		apply the 'Vertex Sort' algorithm (Jothi et al. (2009)
		10.1038/msb.2009.52) to a graph in order to elucidate its
		hierarchical structure. It also allows graphic visualization of
		the sorted graph by exporting the results to a cytoscape
		friendly format. Moreover, it offers five different algorithms
		of graph randomization: 1) Randomize a graph with preserving
		node degrees, 2) with preserving similar node degrees, 3)
		without preserving node degrees, 4) with preserving node in-
		degrees and 5) with preserving node out-degrees.
