		Constrained Generalized Additive Model // A constrained
		generalized additive model is fitted by the cgam routine. Given
		a set of predictors with or without shape or order
		restrictions, the maximum likelihood estimator for the
		constrained generalized additive model is found using an
		iteratively re-weighted cone projection algorithm. The cone
		information criterion (CIC) may be used to select the best
		combination of variables and shapes. This package depends on
		the R package coneproj.
