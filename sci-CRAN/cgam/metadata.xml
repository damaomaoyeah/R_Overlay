		Constrained Generalized Additive Model // A constrained
		generalized additive model is fitted by the cgam routine. Given
		a set of predictors with or without shape or order
		restrictions, the maximum likelihood estimator for the
		constrained generalized additive model is found using an
		iteratively re-weighted cone projection algorithm. The cone
		information criterion (CIC) may be used to select the best
		combination of variables and shapes. One extension of this
		package is isotonic regression in two dimensions using warped-
		plane splines without using additivity assumptions, which is
		implemented by the wps routine.
