		Relational Event Models (REM) // Calculate endogenous network
		effects in event sequences and fit relational event models
		(REM): Using network event sequences (where each tie between a
		sender and a target in a network is time-stamped), REMs can
		measure how networks form and evolve over time. Endogenous
		patterns such as popularity effects, inertia, similarities,
		cycles or triads can be calculated and analyzed over time.
