		Variance estimation of FMT method (Fully Moderated t-statistic)
		// This package computes posterior residual variances to be
		used in the denominator of a moderated t-statistic from a
		linear model analysis of microarray data.  It is an extension
		of the moderated t-statistic original proposed by Smyth (2004).
		LOESS local regression and empirical Bayesian method are used
		to estimate gene specific prior degrees of freedom and prior
		variance based on average gene intensity level. The posterior
		residual variance in the denominator is a weighted average of
		prior and residual variance and the weights are prior degrees
		of freedom and residual variance degrees of freedom. The
		degrees of freedom of the moderated t-statistic is simply the
		sum of prior and residual variance degrees of freedom.
