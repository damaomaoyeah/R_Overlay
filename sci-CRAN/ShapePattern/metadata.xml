		Tools for Analyzing Planar Shape and Associated Patterns // An
		evolving and growing collection of tools for the
		quantification, assessment, and comparison of planar shape and
		pattern. The current flagship functionality is in the spatial
		decomposition of planar shapes using 'ShrinkShape' to
		incrementally shrink shapes to extinction while computing area,
		perimeter, and number of parts at each iteration of shrinking.
		The spectra of results are returned in graphic and tabular
		formats. Additional utility tools for handling data are
		provided and this package will be added to as more tools are
		created, cleaned-up, and documented.
