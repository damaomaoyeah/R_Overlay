		Tools for network tomography // networkTomography implements the
		methods developed and evaluated in Blocker and Airoldi (2011)
		and Airoldi and Blocker (2012). These include the authors' own
		dynamic multilevel model with calibration based upon a Gaussian
		state-space model in addition to implementations of the methods
		of Tebaldi  West (1998; Poisson-Gamma model with MCMC
		sampling), Zhang et al. (2002; tomogravity), Cao et al. (2000;
		Gaussian model with mean-variance relation), and Vardi (1996;
		method of moments). Data from the 1router network of Cao et al.
		(2000), the Abilene network of Fang et al. (2007), and the CMU
		network of Blocker and Airoldi (2011) are included for testing
		and reproducibility.
