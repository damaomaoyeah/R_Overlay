		Random Walks the Intersection of the N-Simplex and Hyperplanes //
		Consider the intersection of two spaces: the complete solution
		space to Ax = b and the N-Simplex. The intersection of these
		two spaces is a convex polytope. The package walkr samples from
		this intersection using two Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC)
		methods: hit-and-run and Dikin walk. Walkr also provide tools
		to examine sample quality.
