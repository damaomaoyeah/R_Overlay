		Rank-hazard plots // Rank-hazard plots (Karvanen and Harrell,
		Statistics in Medicine 2009) visualize the relative importance
		of covariates in a proportional hazards model. The key idea is
		to rank the covariate values and plot the relative hazard as a
		function of ranks scaled to interval [0,1]. The relative hazard
		is plotted in respect to the reference hazard, which can bee.g.
		the hazard related to the median of the covariate.
