		Four Essential Functions for Statistical Distributions Analysis:
		A New Functional Approach // A different way for calculating
		pdf/pmf, cdf, quantile and random data such that the user is
		able to consider the name of related distribution as an
		argument and so easily can changed by a changing argument by
		user. It must be mentioned that the core and computation base
		of package 'DISTRIB' is package 'stats'. Although similar
		functions are introduced previously in package 'stats', but the
		package 'DISTRIB' has some special applications in some special
		computational programs.
