		Estimation using Sequential Offsetted Regression // Estimation
		for longitudinal data following outcome dependent sampling
		using the sequential offsetted regression technique.  Includes
		support for binary, count, and continuous data.  The first
		regression is a logistic regression, which uses a known ratio
		(the probability of being sampled given that the
		subject/observation was referred divided by the probability of
		being sampled given that the subject/observation was no
		referred) as an offset to estimate the probability of being
		referred given outcome and covariates.  The second regression
		uses this estimated probability to calculate the mean
		population response given covariates.
