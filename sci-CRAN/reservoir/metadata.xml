		Tools for Analysis, Design, and Operation of Water Supply
		Storages // Measure single-storage water supply system
		performance using resilience, reliability, and vulnerability
		metrics; assess storage-yield-reliability relationships;
		determine no-fail storage with sequent peak analysis; optimize
		release decisions for water supply, hydropower, and multi-
		objective reservoirs using deterministic and stochastic dynamic
		programming; generate inflow replicates using parametric and
		non-parametric models; evaluate inflow persistence using the
		Hurst coefficient.
