		Synthetic Control Group Method for Comparative Case Studies //
		Implements the synthetic control group method for comparative
		case studies as described in Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and
		Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010, 2011, 2014). The
		synthetic control method allows for effect estimation in
		settings where a single unit (a state, country, firm, etc.) is
		exposed to an event or intervention. It provides a data-driven
		procedure to construct synthetic control units based on a
		weighted combination of comparison units that approximates the
		characteristics of the unit that is exposed to the
		intervention. A combination of comparison units often provides
		a better comparison for the unit exposed to the intervention
		than any comparison unit alone.
