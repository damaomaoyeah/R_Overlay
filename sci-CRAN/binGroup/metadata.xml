		Evaluation and experimental design for binomial group testing //
		This package provides methods for estimation and hypothesis
		testing of proportions in group testing designs. It involves
		methods for estimating a proportion in a single population
		(assuming sensitivity and specificity 1 in designs with equal
		group sizes), as well as hypothesis tests and functions for
		experimental design for this situation. For estimating one
		proportion or the difference of proportions, a number of
		confidence interval methods are included, which can deal with
		various different pool sizes. Further, regression methods are
		implemented for simple pooling and matrix pooling designs.
