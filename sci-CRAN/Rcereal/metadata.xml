		C++11 Header Files for 'cereal' // To facilitate using 'cereal'
		with Rcpp. 'cereal' is a header-only C++11 serialization
		library. 'cereal' takes arbitrary data types and reversibly
		turns them into different representations, such as compact
		binary encodings, XML, or JSON. 'cereal' was designed to be
		fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external
		dependencies and can be easily bundled with other code or used
		standalone. Please see http://uscilab.github.io/cereal for more
		information.
