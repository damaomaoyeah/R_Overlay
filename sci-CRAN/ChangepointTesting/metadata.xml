		Change Point Estimation for Clustered Signals // A multiple
		testing procedure for clustered alternative hypotheses. It is
		assumed that the p-values under the null hypotheses follow
		U(0,1) and that the distributions of p-values from the
		alternative hypotheses are stochastically smaller than U(0,1).
		By aggregating information, this method is more sensitive to
		detecting signals of low magnitude than standard methods.
		Additionally, sporadic small p-values appearing within a null
		hypotheses sequence are avoided by averaging on the neighboring
		p-values.
