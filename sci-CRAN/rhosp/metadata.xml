		Side Effect Risks in Hospital : Simulation and Estimation //
		Evaluating risk (that a patient arises a side effect) during
		hospitalization is the main purpose of this package. Several
		methods (Parametric, non parametric and De Vielder estimation)
		to estimate the risk constant (R) are implemented in this
		package. There are also functions to simulate the different
		models of this issue in order to quantify the previous
		estimators. It is necessary to read at least the first six
		pages of the report to understand the topic.
