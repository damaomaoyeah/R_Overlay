		Omics Data Integration Project // We provide statistical
		integrative techniques and variants to analyse highly
		dimensional data sets: regularized Canonical Correlation
		Analysis ('rCCA') and sparse Partial Least Squares variants
		('sPLS') to unravel relationships between two heterogeneous
		data sets of size (n times p) and (n times q) where the p and q
		variables are measured on the same samples or individuals n.
		These data may come from high throughput technologies, such as
		'omics' data (e.g. transcriptomics, metabolomics or proteomics
		data) that require an integrative or joint analysis. However,
		'mixOmics' can also be applied to any other large data sets
		where p + q  n. 'rCCA' is a regularized version of Canonical
		Correlation Analysis to deal with the large number of
		variables. 'sPLS' allows variable selection in a one step
		procedure and two frameworks are proposed: regression and
		canonical analysis. Numerous graphical outputs are provided to
		help interpreting the results. Recent methodological
		developments include: sparse PLS-Discriminant Analysis ('sPLS-
		DA'), Independent Principal Component Analysis ('IPCA'),
		multilevel analysis using variance decomposition of the data
		and integration of multiple data sets with regularized
		Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis ('rGCCA') and
		variants (sparse 'GCCA'). More details  can be found on our
		website.
