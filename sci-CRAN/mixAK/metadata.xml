		Multivariate Normal Mixture Models and Mixtures of Generalized
		Linear Mixed Models Including Model Based Clustering //
		Contains a mixture of statistical methods including the MCMC
		methods to analyze normal mixtures. Additionally, model based
		clustering methods are implemented to perform classification
		based on (multivariate) longitudinal (or otherwise correlated)
		data. The basis for such clustering is a mixture of
		multivariate generalized linear mixed models.
