		Computational Methods for Immune Cell-Type Subsets // Provided
		are Computational methods for Immune Cell-type Subsets,
		including:(1) DCQ (Digital Cell Quantifier) to infer global
		dynamic changes in immune cell quantities within a complex
		tissue; and (2) VoCAL (Variation of Cell-type Abundance Loci) a
		deconvolution-based method that utilizes transcriptome data to
		infer the quantities of immune-cell types, and then uses these
		quantitative traits to uncover the underlying DNA loci.
