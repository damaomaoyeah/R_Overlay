		Efficient MCMC for Binomial Logit Models // The R package
		contains different MCMC schemes to estimate the regression
		coefficients of a binomial (or binary) logit model within a
		Bayesian framework: a data-augmented independence MH-sampler,
		an auxiliary mixture sampler and a hybrid auxiliary mixture
		(HAM) sampler. All sampling procedures are based on algorithms
		using data augmentation, where the regression coefficients are
		estimated by rewriting the logit model as a latent variable
		model called difference random utility model (dRUM).
