		Exact permutation moments of quadratic form statistics // This
		package gives you the exact first four permutation moments for
		the most commonly used quadratic form statistics, which need
		not be positive definite. The extension of this work to
		quadratic forms greatly expands the utility of density
		approximations for these problems, including for high-
		dimensional applications, where the statistics must be extreme
		in order to exceed stringent testing thresholds. Approximate
		p-values are obtained by matching the exact moments to the
		Pearson family of distributions using the PearsonDS package.
