		Gamma Shape Mixture // This package implements a Bayesian
		approach for estimation of a mixture of gamma distributions in
		which the mixing occurs over the shape parameter. This family
		provides a flexible and novel approach for modeling heavy-
		tailed distributions, it is computationally efficient, and it
		only requires to specify a prior distribution for a single
		parameter.
