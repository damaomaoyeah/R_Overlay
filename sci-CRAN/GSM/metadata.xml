		Gamma Shape Mixture // Implementation of a Bayesian approach for
		estimating a mixture of gamma distributions in which the mixing
		occurs over the shape parameter. This family provides a
		flexible and novel approach for modeling heavy-tailed
		distributions, it is computationally efficient, and it only
		requires to specify a prior distribution for a single
		parameter.
