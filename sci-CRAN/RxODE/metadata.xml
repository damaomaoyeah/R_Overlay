		Facilities for Simulating from ODE-Based Models // Facilities for
		running simulations from ordinary differential equation (ODE)
		models, such as pharmacometrics and other compartmental models.
		A compilation manager translates the ODE model into C, compiles
		it, and dynamically loads the object code into R for improved
		computational efficiency.  An event table object facilitates
		the specification of complex dosing regimens (optional) and
		sampling schedules.
