		A Simple Implementation and Demonstration of Gradient Boosting //
		A basic, clear implementation of tree-based gradient boosting
		designed to illustrate the core operation of boosting models.
		Tuning parameters (such as stochastic subsampling, modified
		learning rate, or regularization) are not implemented. The only
		adjustable parameter is the number of training rounds. If you
		are looking for a high performance boosting implementation with
		tuning parameters, consider the 'xgboost' package.
