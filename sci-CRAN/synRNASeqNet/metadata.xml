		Synthetic RNA-Seq Network Generation and Mutual Information
		Estimates // It implements various estimators of mutual
		information, such as the maximum likelihood and the Millow-
		Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators, the shrinkage
		estimator, and the Chao-Shen estimator. It also offers wrappers
		to the kNN and kernel density estimators. Furthermore, it
		provides various index of performance evaluation such as
		precision, recall, FPR, F-Score, ROC-PR Curves and so on.
		Lastly, it provides a brand new way of generating synthetic
		RNA-Seq Network with known dependence structure.
