		Linear Classification with Online Adaptation of Coordinate
		Frequencies // Solving the linear SVM problem with coordinate
		descent is very efficient and is implemented in one of the most
		often used packages, 'LIBLINEAR' (available at
		http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear). It has been shown
		that the uniform selection of coordinates can be accelerated by
		using an online adaptation of coordinate frequencies (ACF).
		This package implements ACF and is based on 'LIBLINEAR' as well
		as the 'LiblineaR' package
		(https://cran.r-project.org/package=LiblineaR). It currently
		supports L2-regularized L1-loss as well as L2-loss linear SVM.
		Similar to 'LIBLINEAR' multi-class classification (one-vs-the
		rest, and Crammer  Singer method) and cross validation for
		model selection is supported. The training of the models based
		on ACF is much faster than standard 'LIBLINEAR' on many
		problems.
