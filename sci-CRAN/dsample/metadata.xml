		Discretization-based Direct Random Sample Generation // The
		package provides two discretization-based Monte Carlo
		algorithms, namely the Fu-Wang algorithm and the Wang-Lee
		algorithm, for random sample generation from a high dimensional
		distribution of complex structure. The normalizing constant of
		the target distribution needs not to be known.
