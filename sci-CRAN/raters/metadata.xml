		A Modification of Fleiss' Kappa in Case of Nominal and Ordinal
		Variables // The kappa statistic implemented by Fleiss is a
		very popular index for assessing the reliability of agreement
		among multiple observers. It is used both in the psychological
		and in the psychiatric field. Other fields of application are
		typically medicine, biology and engineering. Unfortunately,the
		kappa statistic may behave inconsistently in case of strong
		agreement between raters, since this index assumes lower values
		than it would have been expected. We propose a modification
		kappa implemented by Fleiss in case of nominal and ordinal
		variables. Monte Carlo simulations are used both to testing
		statistical hypotheses and to calculating percentile bootstrap
		confidence intervals based on proposed statistic in case of
		nominal and ordinal data.
