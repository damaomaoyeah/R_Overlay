		Statistical Inference for MOdular NEtworks (SIMoNe) // The R
		package simone implements the inference of co-expression
		networks based on partial correlation coefficients from either
		steady-state or time-course transcriptomic data. Note that with
		both type of data this package can deal with samples collected
		in different experimental conditions and therefore not
		identically distributed. In this particular case, multiple but
		related networks are inferred on one simone run.
