		Analyze Biogas Data and Predict Biogas Production // Functions
		for working with biogas data. Both low- and high-level
		functions are included for carrying out common tasks for
		analysis of biogas and related data. Molar mass and calculated
		oxygen demand (COD') can be determined from a chemical formula.
		Measured gas volume can be corrected for water vapor and to
		(possibly user-defined) standard temperature and pressure. Gas
		composition, cumulative production, or other variables can be
		interpolated to a specified time. Cumulative biogas and methane
		production (and rates) can be calculated from individual biogas
		volume (or reactor mass) and biogas composition measurements
		for any number of reactors. With cumulative methane production
		data and data on reactor contents, biochemical methane
		potential (BMP) can be calculated and summarized, including
		subtraction of the inoculum contribution and normalization by
		substrate mass. Cumulative production and production rates can
		be summarized in several different ways (e.g., omitting
		normalization) using the same function. Lastly, biogas and
		methane production can be predicted from substrate composition
		and additional, optional data.
