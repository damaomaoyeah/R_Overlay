		Miscellaneous Extensions to 'ggplot2' // Implements extensions to
		'ggplot2' respecting the grammar of graphics paradigm. Provides
		new stats to locate and tag peaks and valleys in 2D plots, a
		stat to add a label by group with the equation of a polynomial
		fitted with lm(), or R^2 or adjusted R^2 values for any model
		fitted with function lm(). Provides a function for flexibly
		converting time series to data frames suitable for plotting
		with ggplot(). In addition provides two stats useful for
		diagnosing what data are passed to compute_group() and
		compute_panel() functions.
