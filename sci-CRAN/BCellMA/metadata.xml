		B Cell Receptor Somatic Hyper Mutation Analysis // Includes a set
		of functions to analyze for instance nucleotide frequencies as
		well as transition and  transversion. Can reconstruct germline
		sequences based on the international ImMunoGeneTics information
		system (IMGT/HighV-QUEST) outputs, calculate and plot the
		difference (%) of nucleotides at 6 positions around a mutation
		to identify and characterize hotspot motifs as well as
		calculate and plot average mutation frequencies of nucleotide
		mutations resulting in amino acid substitution.
