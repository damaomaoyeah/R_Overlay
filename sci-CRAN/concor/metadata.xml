		Concordance // The four functions svdcp (cp for column
		partitioned), svdbip or svdbip2 (bip for bi-partitioned), and
		svdbips (s for a simultaneous optimization of one set of r
		solutions), correspond to a "SVD by blocks" notion, by
		supposing each block depending on relative subspaces, rather
		than on two whole spaces as usual SVD does. The other
		functions, based on this notion, are relative to two column
		partitioned data matrices x and y defining two sets of subsets
		xi and yj of variables and amount to estimate a link between xi
		and yj for the pair (xi, yj) relatively to the links associated
		to all the other pairs.
