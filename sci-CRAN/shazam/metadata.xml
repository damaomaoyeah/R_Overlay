		Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation Analysis // Provides a
		computational framework for Bayesian estimation of antigen-
		driven selection in immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences, providing an
		intuitive means of analyzing selection by quantifying the
		degree of selective pressure. Also provides tools to profile
		mutations in Ig sequences, build models of somatic
		hypermutation (SHM) in Ig sequences, and make model-dependent
		distance comparisons of Ig repertoires.
