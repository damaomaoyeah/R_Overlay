		Determine Position of Observer // Measuring angles between points
		in a landscape is much easier than measuring distances. When
		the location of three points is known the position of the
		observer can be determined based solely on the angles between
		these points as seen by the observer. This task (known as
		triangulation) however requires onerous calculations - these
		calculations are automated by this package.
