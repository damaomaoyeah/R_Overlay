		A Set of RStudio Addins // A set of RStudio addins that are
		designed to be used in combination with user-defined RStudio
		keyboard shortcuts. These addins either: 1) insert text at a
		cursor position (e.g. insert operators %%, -, %$%, etc.), 2)
		replace symbols in selected pieces of text (e.g., convert
		backslashes to forward slashes which results in stings like
		"c:\data\" converted into "c:/data/") or 3) enclose text with
		special symbols (e.g., converts "bold" into "**bold**") which
		is convenient for editing R Markdown files.
