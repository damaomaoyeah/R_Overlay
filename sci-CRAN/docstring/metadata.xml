		Provides Docstring Capabilities to R Functions // Provides the
		ability to display something analogous to Python's docstrings
		within R.  By allowing the user to document their functions as
		comments at the beginning of their function without requiring
		putting the function into a package we allow more users to
		easily provide documentation for their functions. The
		documentation can be viewed just like any other help files for
		functions provided by packages as well.
