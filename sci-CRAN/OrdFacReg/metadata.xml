		Least Squares, Logistic, and Cox-Regression with Ordered
		Predictors // In biomedical studies, researchers are often
		interested in assessing the association between one or more
		ordinal explanatory variables and an outcome variable, at the
		same time adjusting for covariates of any type. The outcome
		variable may be continuous, binary, or represent censored
		survival times. In the absence of a precise knowledge of the
		response function, using monotonicity constraints on the
		ordinal variables improves efficiency in estimating parameters,
		especially when sample sizes are small. This package implements
		an active set algorithm that efficiently computes such
		estimators.
