		Text Generation from Data // Linguistic Descriptions of Complex
		Phenomena (LDCP) is an architecture and methodology that allows
		us to model complex phenomena, interpreting input data, and
		generating automatic text reports customized to the user needs
		(see doi:10.1016/j.ins.2016.11.002 and
		doi:10.1007/s00500-016-2430-5). The proposed package contains a
		set of methods that facilitates the development of LDCP
		systems. It main goal is increasing the visibility and
		practical use of this research line.
