		Fast Spatial Ancestry via Flexible Allele Frequency Surfaces //
		Used primarily for estimates of allele frequency surfaces from
		point estimates. It can also place individuals of unknown
		origin back onto the geographic map with great accuracy.
		Additionally, it can place admixed individuals by estimating
		contributing fractions at each location on a map. Lastly, it
		can rank SNPs by their ability to differentiate populations.
		See "Fast Spatial Ancestry via Flexible Allele Frequency
		Surfaces" (John Michael Ranola, John Novembre, Kenneth Lange)
		in Bioinformatics 2014 for more info.
