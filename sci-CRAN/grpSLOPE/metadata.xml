		Group Sorted L1 Penalized Estimation // Group SLOPE is a
		penalized linear regression method that is used for adaptive
		selection of groups of significant predictors in a high-
		dimensional linear model. The Group SLOPE method can control
		the (group) false discovery rate at a user-specified level
		(i.e., control the expected proportion of irrelevant among all
		selected groups of predictors).
