		Constructs the Exterior Match from Two Matched Control Groups //
		If one treated group is matched to one control reservoir in two
		different ways to produce two sets of treated-control matched
		pairs, then the two control groups may be entwined, in the
		sense that some control individuals are in both control groups.
		The exterior match is used to compare the two control groups.
