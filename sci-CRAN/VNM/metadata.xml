		Using V-algorithm and Newton-Raphson Method to Obtain Multiple-
		objective Optimal Design // Using V-algorithm and Newton-
		Raphson method to obtain multiple-objective optimal design for
		estimating the shape of dose-response, the ED50 (the dose
		producing an effect midway between the expected responses at
		the extreme doses) and the MED (the minimum effective dose
		level) for the 2,3,4-parameter logistic models and for
		evaluating its efficiencies for the three objectives.
