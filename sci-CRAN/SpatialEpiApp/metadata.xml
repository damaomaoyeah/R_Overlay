		A Shiny Web Application for the Analysis of Spatial and Spatio-
		Temporal Disease Data // Runs a Shiny web application that
		allows to visualize spatial and spatio-temporal disease data,
		estimate disease risk and detect clusters. The application
		allows to fit Bayesian disease models to obtain risk estimates
		and their uncertainty by using the 'R-INLA' package,
		http://www.r-inla.org, and to detect clusters by using the scan
		statistics implemented in 'SaTScan', https://www.satscan.org.
		The application allows user interaction and creates interactive
		visualizations such as maps supporting padding and zooming and
		tables that allow for filtering. It also enables the generation
		of reports containing the analyses performed.
