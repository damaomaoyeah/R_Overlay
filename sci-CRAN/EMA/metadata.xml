		Easy Microarray data Analysis // We propose both a clear analysis
		strategy and a selection of tools to investigate microarray
		gene expression data. The most usual and relevant existing R
		functions were discussed, validated and gathered in an easy-to-
		use R package (EMA) devoted to gene expression microarray
		analysis. These functions were improved for ease of use,
		enhanced visualisation and better interpretation of results.
