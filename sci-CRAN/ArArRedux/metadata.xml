		Rigorous Data Reduction and Error Propagation of '40Ar/39Ar' Data
		// Processes noble gas mass spectrometer data to determine the
		isotopic composition of argon (comprised of 36Ar, 37Ar, 38Ar,
		39Ar and 40Ar) released from neutron-irradiated potassium-
		bearing minerals. Then uses these compositions to calculate
		precise and accurate geochronological ages for multiple samples
		as well as the covariances between them. Error propagation is
		done in matrix form, which jointly treats all samples and all
		isotopes simultaneously at every step of the data reduction
		process. The package includes methods for regression of the
		time-resolved mass spectrometer signals to t=0 ('time zero')
		for both single- and multi-collector instruments, blank
		correction, mass fractionation correction, detector
		intercalibration, decay corrections, interference corrections,
		interpolation of the irradiation parameter between neutron
		fluence monitors, and (weighted mean) age calculation. All
		operations are performed on the logs of the ratios between the
		different argon isotopes so as to properly treat them as
		'compositional data', sensu Aitchison [1986, The Statistics of
		Compositional Data, Chapman and Hall].
