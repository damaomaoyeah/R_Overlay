		Send messages, images, R objects and files to Slack.com
		channels/users // Slackr contains functions that make it
		possible to interact with Slack.com messaging platform. When
		you need to share information/data from R, rather than resort
		to copy/paste in e-mails or other services like Skype, you can
		use this package to send well-formatted output from multiple R
		objects and expressions to all teammates at the same time with
		little effort. You can also send images from the current
		graphics device, R objects (as RData), and upload files.
