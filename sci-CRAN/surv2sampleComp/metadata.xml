		Inference for model-free between-group parameters for censored
		survival data. // Performs inference of several model-free
		group contrast measures, which include difference/ratio of
		cumulative incidence rates at given time points, quantiles, and
		restricted mean survival times (RMST). Two kinds of covariate
		adjustment procedures (i.e., regression and augmentation) for
		inference of the metrics based on RMST are also included.
