		Frailty Models via H-likelihood // The frailtyHL package
		implements the h-likelihood estimation procedures for frailty
		models. The package fits Cox's proportional hazards models with
		random effects (or frailties). For the frailty distribution
		lognormal and gamma are allowed. The h-likelihood uses the
		Laplace approximation when the numerical integration is
		intractable, giving a statistically efficient estimation in
		frailty models.
