		Vector analysis using graphical and analytical methods in 3D //
		This package performs a 3D statistical analysis, both numerical
		and graphical, of a set of vectors. Since a vector has three
		components (a module and two angles) vectorial analysis is
		performed in two stages: modules are analyzed by means of
		linear statistics and orientations are analyzed by spherical
		statistics. Tests and spherical statistic parameters are
		accompanied by a graphs as: density maps, distribution modules
		and angles. The tests, spherical statistic parameters and
		graphs allow us detecting another distribution properties (i.e.
		anisotropy) and outliers.
