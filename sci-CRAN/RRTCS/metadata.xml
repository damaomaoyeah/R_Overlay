		Randomized Response Techniques for Complex Surveys // Point and
		interval estimation of linear parameters with data obtained
		from complex surveys (including stratified and clustered
		samples) when randomization techniques are used. The randomized
		response technique was developed to obtain estimates that are
		more valid when studying sensitive topics. Estimators and
		variances for 14 randomized response methods for qualitative
		variables and 7 randomized response methods for quantitative
		variables are also implemented. In addition, some data sets
		from surveys with these randomization methods are included in
		the package.
