		First Passage Time Simulation for Gaussian Diffusion Processes //
		In this package we consider Gaussian Diffusion processes and
		smooth thresholds. After evaluating the mean of the process to
		check the subthreshold regimen hypothesis, the FPT density
		function is reconstructed via the numerical quadrature of the
		integral equation in (Buonocore 1987); first passage times are
		also generated by the method in (Buonocore 2014) and results
		are compared. The timestep of the simulations can iteratively
		be refined. User should provide the functional form for the
		drift and the infinitesimal variance in the script 'userfunc.R'
		and for the threshold in the script 'userthresh.R'. All the
		parameters required by the implementation are to be set in the
		script 'userparam.R'. Example scripts for common drifts and
		thresholds are given.
