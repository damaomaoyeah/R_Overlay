		A package for geocoding, reverse geocoding and coordinate
		transformations between WGS-84, GCJ-02 and BD-09 coordinate
		systems // In China the digital maps use two main Geographic
		Coordinate Systems (GCSs), namely GCJ-02 and BD-09, rather than
		the well known WGS-84 because of information security. geoChina
		provides functions for the mutual coordinate conversions
		between those three GCSs. Therefore, when geocoding address or
		reverse geocoding latitude/longitude location by calling either
		Google or Baidu Geocoding API, geoChina allows for inputting or
		outputting the coordinates in the GCS different from the one
		that Google or Baidu map uses.
