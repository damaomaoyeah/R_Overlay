		Dealing with very large datasets using BIRCH // birch is an
		implementation of the algorithms described in Zhang et al
		(1997), and provides functions for creating CF-trees, along
		with algorithms for dealing with some combinatorial problems,
		such as covMcd and ltsReg. It is very well suited for dealing
		with very large data sets, and does not require that the data
		can fit in physical memory.
