		General-to-Specific (GETS) Modelling and Indicator Saturation
		Methods // Automated multi-path General-to-Specific (GETS)
		modelling of the mean and variance of a regression, and
		indicator saturation methods for detecting structural breaks in
		the mean. The mean can be specified as an autoregressive model
		with covariates (an 'AR-X' model), and the variance can be
		specified as a log-variance model with covariates (a 'log-
		ARCH-X' model). The four main functions of the package are arx,
		getsm, getsv and isat. The first function, arx, estimates an
		AR-X model with log-ARCH-X errors. The second function, getsm,
		undertakes GETS model selection of the mean specification of an
		arx object. The third function, getsv, undertakes GETS model
		selection of the log-variance specification of an arx object.
		The fourth function, isat, undertakes GETS model selection of
		an indicator saturated mean specification.
