		Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend // A
		program for analyzing vegetation time series, with two
		algorithms: 1) change detection algorithm that detects trend
		changes, determines their type (abrupt or non-abrupt), and
		estimates their timing, magnitude, number, and direction; 2)
		generalization algorithm that simplifies the temporal trend
		into main features. The user can set the number of major
		breakpoints or magnitude of greatest changes of interest for
		detection, and can control the generalization process by
		setting an additional parameter of generalization-percentage.
