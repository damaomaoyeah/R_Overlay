		Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST) //
		An algorithm for analysing vegetation time series with two main
		application domains - generalising vegetation trends and
		characterizing vegetation trend changes. The algorithm
		simplifies the trend into linear segments using one of three
		parameters: a generalisation threshold parameter, the largest
		changes, or a threshold for the magnitude of changes. The
		outputs are the simplified trend, the change type (abrupt or
		non-abrupt), and the time and magnitude of the change.
