		Control Charts for Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Distribution // The
		main purpose of this package is to juxtapose the different
		control limits obtained by modelling a data set through the
		COM-Poisson distribution vs. the classical Poisson
		distribution. Accordingly, this package offers the ability to
		compute the COM-Poisson parameter estimates and plot associated
		Shewhart control charts for a given data set.
