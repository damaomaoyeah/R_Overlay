		Computing Fuzzy p-Value // The main goal of this package is
		drawing the membership function of the fuzzy p-value which is
		defined as a fuzzy set on the unit interval for three following
		problems: (1) testing crisp hypotheses based on fuzzy data, (2)
		testing fuzzy hypotheses based on crisp data, and (3) testing
		fuzzy hypotheses based on fuzzy data. In all cases, the
		fuzziness of data or/and the fuzziness of the boundary of null
		fuzzy hypothesis transported via the p-value function and
		causes to produce the fuzzy p-value. If the p-value is fuzzy,
		it is more appropriate to consider a fuzzy significance level
		for the problem. Therefore, the comparison of the fuzzy p-value
		and the fuzzy significance level is evaluated by a fuzzy
		ranking method in this package.
