		Confidence intervals and sample size determination for a binomial
		proportion under simple random sampling and pooled sampling //
		A suite of functions to compute confidence intervals and
		necessary sample sizes for the parameter p of the Bernoulli
		B(p) distribution under simple random sampling or under pooled
		sampling. Such computations are e.g. of interest when
		investigating the incidence or prevalence in populations. The
		package contains functions to compute coverage probabilities
		and coverage coefficients of the provided confidence intervals
		procedures. Sample size calculations are based on expected
		length.
