		Utilities for Working with R's Operators // Provides a collection
		of utilities that allow programming with R's operators.
		Routines allow classifying operators, translating to and from
		an operator and its underlying function, and inverting some
		operators (e.g. comparison operators), etc. All methods can be
		extended to custom infix operators.
