		Missing Value Imputation for Accelerometer Data // Imputation for
		the missing count values in accelerometer data. The methodology
		includes both parametric and semi-parametric multiple
		imputations under the zero-inflated Poisson lognormal model.
		This package also provides multiple functions to pre-process
		the accelerometer data previous to the missing data imputation.
		These includes detecting wearing and non-wearing time,
		selecting valid days and subjects, and creating plots.
