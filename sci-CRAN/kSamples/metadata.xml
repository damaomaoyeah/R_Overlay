		K-Sample Rank Tests and their Combinations // Compares k samples
		using the Anderson-Darling test, Kruskal-Wallis type tests with
		different rank score criteria, Steel's multiple comparison
		test, and the Jonckheere-Terpstra (JT) test. It computes
		asymptotic, simulated or (limited) exact P-values, all valid
		under randomization, with or without ties, or conditionally
		under random sampling from populations, given the observed tie
		pattern.  Except for Steel's test and the JT test it also
		combines these tests across several blocks of samples.  Also
		analyzed are 2 x t contingency tables and their blocked
		combinations using the Kruskal-Wallis criterion.  Steel's test
		is inverted to provide simultaneous confidence bounds for shift
		parameters.  A plotting function compares tail probabilities
		obtained under asymptotic approximation with those obtained via
		simulation or exact calculations.
