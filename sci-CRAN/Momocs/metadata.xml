		Shape Analysis of Outlines // Momocs is intended to ease and
		popularize shape analysis of outlines (especially using
		elliptical Fourier analysis). It mostly hinges on the functions
		developed in Morphometrics with R (Claude, 2008). From outline
		extraction of images and elliptical Fourier calculation to
		multivariate analysis and the visualization of transformations
		within the morphological space, Momocs provides a complete and
		convenient toolkit to specialists within every field that are,
		or may be, interested in morphological comparisons of outlines.
