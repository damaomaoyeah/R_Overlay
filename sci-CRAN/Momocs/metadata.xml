		Morphometrics using R // A complete toolkit for morphometrics,
		from data extraction to multivariate analyses. Most common 2D
		morphometrics approaches are included: outlines, open outlines,
		configurations of landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and
		facilities for data preparation, manipulation and visualization
		with a consistent grammar throughout. Momocs allows
		reproducible, complex morphometric analyses, paves the way for
		a pure open-source workflow in R, and other morphometrics
		approaches should be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top
		of this canvas.
