		Network Fingerprint Framework in R // An implementation of the
		network fingerprint framework that introduced in paper "Network
		fingerprint: a knowledge-based characterization of biomedical
		networks" (Cui, 2015) doi:10.1038/srep13286. This method worked
		by making systematic comparisons to a set of well-studied
		"basic networks", measuring both the functional and topological
		similarity.  A biological could be characterized as a spectrum-
		like vector consisting of similarities to basic networks. It
		shows great potential in biological network study.
