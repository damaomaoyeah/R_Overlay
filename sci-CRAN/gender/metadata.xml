		Predict Gender from Names Using Historical Data // Encodes gender
		based on names and dates of birth using historical datasets. By
		using these datasets instead of lists of male and female names,
		this package is able to more accurately guess the gender of a
		name, and it is able to report the probability that a name was
		male or female.
