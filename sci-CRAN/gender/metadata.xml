		Predict Gender from Names Using Historical Data // Encodes gender
		based on names and dates of birth, using either the Social
		Security Administration's data set of first names by year of
		birth or the Census Bureau data from 1789 to 1940, both from
		the United States of America. By using these data sets instead
		of lists of male and female names, this package is able to more
		accurately guess the gender of a name, and it is able to report
		the probability that a name was male or female.
