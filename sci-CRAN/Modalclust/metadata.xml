		Hierarchical Modal Clustering // Performs Modal Clustering (MAC)
		including Hierarchical Modal Clustering (HMAC) along with their
		parallel implementation (PHMAC) over several processors.  These
		model-based non-parametric clustering techniques can extract
		clusters in very high dimensions with arbitrary density shapes.
		By default clustering is performed over several resolutions and
		the results are summarised as a hierarchical tree. Associated
		plot functions are also provided. There is a package vignette
		that provides many examples. This version adheres to CRAN
		policy of not spanning more than two child processes by
		default.
