		Spatially weighted context data for multilevel modelling // The
		package provides tools to construct and exploit spatially
		weighted context data. Spatial weights are derived by a Kernel
		function from a user-defined matrix of distances between
		contextual units. Spatial weights can then be applied either to
		precise contextual measures or to aggregate estimates based on
		micro-level survey data, to compute spatially weighted context
		data. Available aggregation functions include indicators of
		central tendency, dispersion, or inter-group variability, and
		take into account survey design weights. The package further
		allows combining the resulting spatially weighted context data
		with individual-level predictor and outcome variables, for the
		purposes of multilevel modelling. An ad hoc stratified
		bootstrap resampling procedure generates robust point estimates
		for multilevel regression coefficients and model fit
		indicators, and computes confidence intervals adjusted for
		measurement dependency and measurement error of aggregate
		estimates. As an additional feature, residual and explained
		spatial dependency can be estimated for the tested models.
