		True Random Numbers using RANDOM.ORG // The true random number
		service provided by the RANDOM.ORG website created by Mads
		Haahr samples atmospheric noise via radio tuned to an unused
		broadcasting frequency together with a skew correction
		algorithm due to John von Neumann.  More background is
		available in the included vignette based on an essay by Mads
		Haahr.  In its current form, the package offers functions to
		retrieve random integers, randomized sequences and random
		strings.
