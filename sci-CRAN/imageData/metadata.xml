		Aids in Processing and Plotting Data from a Lemna-Tec
		Scananalyzer // Extracts traits from imaging data produced
		using a Lemna-Tec Scananalyzer (see
		http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-
		3d for more information). Growth rates between successive
		imagings are obtained and those for a nominated set of
		intervals can also be calculated. Profile or longitudinal plots
		of the traits and growth rates can be produced. These allow one
		to check for anomalous data and to explore growth patterns in
		the data.
