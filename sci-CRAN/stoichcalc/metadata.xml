		R Functions for Solving Stoichiometric Equations // Given a list
		of substance compositions, a list of substances involved in a
		process, and a list of constraints in addition to mass
		conservation of elementary constituents, the package contains
		functions to build the substance composition matrix, to analyze
		the uniqueness of process stoichiometry, and to calculate
		stoichiometric coefficients if process stoichiometry is unique.
		(See Reichert, P. and Schuwirth, N., A generic framework for
		deriving process stoichiometry in enviromental models,
		Environmental Modelling and Software 25, 1241-1251, 2010 for
		more details.)
