		Nonparametric Stability Analysis // An alternative to carrying
		out phenotypic adaptability and stability analyses, taking into
		account nonparametric statistics. Can be used as a robust
		approach, less sensitive to departures from common genotypic,
		environmental, and GxE effects data assumptions (e.g., normal
		distribution of errors).
