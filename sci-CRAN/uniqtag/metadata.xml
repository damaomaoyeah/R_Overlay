		Abbreviate Strings to Short, Unique Identifiers // For each
		string in a set of strings, determine a unique tag that is a
		substring of fixed size k unique to that string, if it has one.
		If no such unique substring exists, the least frequent
		substring is used. If multiple unique substrings exist, the
		lexicographically smallest substring is used. This
		lexicographically smallest substring of size k is called the
		"UniqTag" of that string.
