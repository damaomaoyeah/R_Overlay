		Collapsed Gibbs Sampling Methods for Topic Models // Implements
		latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and related models.  This
		includes (but is not limited to) sLDA, corrLDA, and the mixed-
		membership stochastic blockmodel.  Inference for all of these
		models is implemented via a fast collapsed Gibbs sampler
		written in C.  Utility functions for reading/writing data
		typically used in topic models, as well as tools for examining
		posterior distributions are also included.
