		Floating-Point Genetic Algorithms with Statistical Forecast Based
		Inheritance Operator // The implemented algorithm performs a
		floating-point genetic algorithm search with a statistical
		forecasting operator that generates offspring which probably
		will be generated in future generations. Use of this operator
		enhances the search capabilities of floating-point genetic
		algorithms because offspring generated by usual genetic
		operators rapidly forecasted before performing more
		generations.
