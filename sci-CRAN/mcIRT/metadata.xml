		IRT models for multiple choice items (mcIRT) // This package
		provides functions to estimate two popular IRT-models: The
		Nominal Response Model (Bock 1972) and the quite recently
		developed Nested Logit Model (Suh  Bolt 2010). These are two
		models to examine multiple-choice items and other
		multicategorial response formats.
