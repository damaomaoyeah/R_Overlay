		Visualization of Functional Analysis Data // Implementation of
		multilayered visualizations for enhanced graphical
		representation of functional analysis data. It combines and
		integrates omics data derived from expression and functional
		annotation enrichment analyses. Its plotting functions have
		been developed with an hierarchical structure in mind: starting
		from a general overview to identify the most enriched
		categories (modified bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed
		one displaying different types of relevant information for the
		molecules in a given set of categories (circle plot, chord
		plot, cluster plot, Venn diagram, heatmap).
