		R genetic programming framework // RGP is a simple modular
		Genetic Programming (GP) system build in pure R. In addition to
		general GP tasks, the system supports Symbolic Regression by GP
		through the familiar R model formula interface. GP individuals
		are represented as R expressions, an (optional) type system
		enables domain-specific function sets containing functions of
		diverse domain- and range types. A basic set of genetic
		operators for variation (mutation and crossover) and selection
		is provided.
