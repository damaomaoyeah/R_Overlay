		Provides 'dplyr' verbs for lists and other useful verbs for
		manipulation of data frames. In particular, it includes a
		mutate_which() function that mutates columns for a specific
		subset of rows defined by a condition, and fuse() which is a
		more flexible version of 'tidyr' unite() function.
