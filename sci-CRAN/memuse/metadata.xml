		Estimate the memory usage of dense, in-core, numeric objects. //
		How much ram do you need to store a 100,000 by 100,000 matrix?
		Learn the scintillating answer to this and many more such
		questions with the memuse package.  This package gives the user
		the size (memory usage) of an unallocated, in-core, dense,
		numeric matrix.  The output is an S4 class object that can be
		manipulated to be presented in different ways (different units,
		short/long versions of those units, etc.).  The package offers
		similar functionality to that of R's object.size() function,
		with the key difference being that memuse does not require an
		object to already be allocated.  So one can determine the size
		of enormous matrices even from a laptop.
