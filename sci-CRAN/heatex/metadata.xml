		Heat exchange calculations during physical activity. // The
		heatex package calculates heat storage in the body and the
		components of heat exchange (conductive, convective, radiative,
		and evaporative) between the body and the environment during
		physical activity based on the principles of partitional
		calorimetry. The program enables heat exchange calculations for
		a range of environmental conditions when wearing various
		clothing ensembles.
