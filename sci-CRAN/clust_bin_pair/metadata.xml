		Statistical Methods for Analyzing Clustered Matched Pair Data //
		Tests, utilities, and case studies for analyzing significance
		in clustered binary matched-pair data. The central function
		clust.bin.pair uses one of several tests to calculate a Chi-
		square statistic. Implemented are the tests Eliasziw,
		Obuchowski, Durkalski, and Yang with McNemar included for
		comparison. The utility functions nested.to.contingency and
		paired.to.contingency convert data between various useful
		formats. Thyroids and psychiatry are the canonical datasets
		from Obuchowski and Petryshen respectively.
