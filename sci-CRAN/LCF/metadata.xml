		Linear Combination Fitting // Baseline correction, normalization
		and linear combination fitting (LCF) of X-ray absorption near
		edge structure (XANES) spectra. The package includes data
		loading of .xmu files exported from 'ATHENA' (Ravel and
		Newville, 2005) doi:10.1107/S0909049505012719. Loaded spectra
		can be background corrected and all standards can be fitted at
		once. Two linear combination fitting functions can be used: (1)
		fit_athena(): Simply fitting combinations of standards as in
		ATHENA, (2) fit_float(): Fitting all standards with changing
		baseline correction and edge-step normalization parameters.
