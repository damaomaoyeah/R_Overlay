		Convert Statistical Analysis Objects into Tidy Data Frames //
		Convert statistical analysis objects from R into tidy data
		frames, so that they can more easily be combined, reshaped and
		otherwise processed with tools like 'dplyr', 'tidyr' and
		'ggplot2'. The package provides three S3 generics: tidy, which
		summarizes a model's statistical findings such as coefficients
		of a regression; augment, which adds columns to the original
		data such as predictions, residuals and cluster assignments;
		and glance, which provides a one-row summary of model-level
		statistics.
