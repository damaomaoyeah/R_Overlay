		K-Means for Joint Longitudinal Data // An implementation of
		k-means specifically design to cluster joint trajectories
		(longitudinal data on several variable-trajectories). Like
		'kml', it provides facilities to deal with missing value,
		compute several quality criterion (Calinski and Harabatz, Ray
		and Turie, Davies and Bouldin, BIC,...) and propose a graphical
		interface for choosing the 'best' number of clusters. In
		addition, the 3D graph representing the mean joint-trajectories
		of each cluster can be exported through LaTeX in a 3D dynamic
		rotating PDF graph.
