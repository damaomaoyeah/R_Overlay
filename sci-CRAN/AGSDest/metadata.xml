		Estimation in Adaptive Group Sequential Trials // Calculation of
		repeated confidence intervals as well as confidence intervals
		based on the stage-wise ordering in group sequential designs
		and adaptive group sequential designs. For adaptive group
		sequential designs the confidence intervals are based on the
		conditional rejection probability principle. Currently the
		procedures do not support the use of futility boundaries or
		more than one adaptive interim analysis.
