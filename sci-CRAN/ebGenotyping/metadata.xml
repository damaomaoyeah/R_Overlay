		Genotyping and SNP Detection using Next Generation Sequencing
		Data // Genotyping the population using next generation
		sequencing data is essentially important for the rare variant
		detection. In order to distinguish the genomic structural
		variation from sequencing error, we propose a statistical model
		which involves the genotype effect through a latent variable to
		depict the distribution of non-reference allele frequency data
		among different samples and different genome loci, while
		decomposing the sequencing error into sample effect and
		positional effect. An ECM algorithm is implemented to estimate
		the model parameters, and then the genotypes and SNPs are
		inferred based on the empirical Bayes method.
