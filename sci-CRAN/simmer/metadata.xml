		Discrete-Event Simulation for R // A process-oriented and
		trajectory-based Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) package for R.
		Designed to be a generic framework like SimPy or SimJulia, it
		leverages the use of Rcpp to boost the performance, turning DES
		in R feasible. As a noteworthy characteristic, simmer exploits
		the concept of trajectory: a common path in the simulation
		model for entities of the same type.
