		Identifiability of linear structural equation models // This
		package provides routines to check identifiability or non-
		identifiability of linear structural equation models as
		described in Drton, Foygel  Sullivant (Ann. Statist., 2011) and
		Foygel, Draisma  Drton (Ann. Statist., 2012).  The routines are
		based on the graphical representation of structural equation
		models by a path diagram/mixed graph.
