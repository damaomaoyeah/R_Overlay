		Random Uniform Forests for Classification, Regression and
		Unsupervised Learning // Ensemble model, for classification,
		regression and unsupervised learning, based on a forest of
		unpruned and randomized binary decision trees. Each tree is
		grown by sampling, with replacement, a set of variables at each
		node. Each cut-point is generated randomly, according to the
		continuous Uniform distribution. For each tree, data are either
		bootstrapped or subsampled. The unsupervised mode introduces
		clustering, dimension reduction and variable importance, using
		a three-layer engine. Random Uniform Forests are mainly aimed
		to lower correlation between trees (or trees residuals), to
		provide a deep analysis of variable importance and to allow
		native distributed and incremental learning.
