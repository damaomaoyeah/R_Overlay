		Standard Error Adjusted Adaptive Lasso // Standard error adjusted
		adaptive lasso (SEA-lasso) is a version of the adaptive lasso,
		which incorporates OLS standard error to the L1 penalty weight.
		This method is intended for variable selection under linear
		regression settings (n  p). This new weight assignment strategy
		is especially useful when the collinearity of the design matrix
		is a concern.
