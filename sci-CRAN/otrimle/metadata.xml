		Robust Model-Based Clustering // Performs robust cluster analysis
		allowing for outliers and noise that cannot be fitted by any
		cluster. The data are modelled by a mixture of Gaussian
		distributions and a noise component, which is an improper
		uniform  distribution covering the whole Euclidean space.
		Parameters are estimated by  (pseudo) maximum likelihood. This
		is fitted by a EM-type algorithm. See Coretto and Hennig (2015)
		https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0808, and Coretto and Hennig (2016)
