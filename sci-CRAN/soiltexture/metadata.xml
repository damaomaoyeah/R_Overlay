		Functions for Soil Texture Plot, Classification and
		Transformation // "The Soil Texture Wizard" is a set of R
		functions designed to produce texture triangles (also called
		texture plots, texture diagrams, texture ternary plots),
		classify and transform soil textures data. These functions
		virtually allows to plot any soil texture triangle
		(classification) into any triangle geometry (isosceles, right-
		angled triangles, etc.). This set of function is expected to be
		useful to people using soil textures data from different soil
		texture classification or different particle size systems. Many
		( 15) texture triangles from all around the world are
		predefined in the package. A simple text based graphical user
		interface is provided: soiltexture_gui().
