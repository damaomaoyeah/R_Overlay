		Weighted Descriptive Statistics // Weighted descriptive
		statistics is the discipline of quantitatively describing the
		main features of real-valued fuzzy data which usually given
		from a fuzzy population. One can summarize this special kind of
		fuzzy data numerically or graphically using this package. To
		interpret some of the properties of one or several sets of
		real-valued fuzzy data, numerically summarize is possible by
		some weighted statistics which are designed in this package
		such as mean, variance, covariance and correlation coefficent.
		Also, graphically interpretation can be given by weighted
		histogram and weighted scatter plot using this package to
		describe properties of real-valued fuzzy data set.
