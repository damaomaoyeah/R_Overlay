		Data Only: Algorithmic Complexity of Short Strings (Computed via
		Coding Theorem Method) // Data only package providing the
		algorithmic complexity of short strings, computed using the
		coding theorem method. For a given set of symbols in a string,
		all possible or a large number of random samples of Turing
		machines (TM) with a given number of states (e.g., 5) and
		number of symbols corresponding to the number of symbols in the
		strings were simulated until they reached a halting state or
		failed to end. This package contains data on 4.5 million
		strings from length 1 to 12 simulated on TMs with 2, 4, 5, 6,
		and 9 symbols. The complexity of the string corresponds to the
		distribution of the halting states of the TMs.
