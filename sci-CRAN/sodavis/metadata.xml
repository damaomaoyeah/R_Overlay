		SODA: Main and Interaction Effects Selection for Discriminant
		Analysis and Logistic Regression // Variable and interaction
		selection are essential to classification in high-dimensional
		setting. In this package, we provide the implementation of SODA
		procedure, which is a forward-backward algorithm that selects
		both main and interaction effects under quadratic discriminant
		analysis and logistic regression model.
