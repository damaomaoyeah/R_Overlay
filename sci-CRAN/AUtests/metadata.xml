		Approximate Unconditional and Permutation Tests // Performs
		approximate unconditional and permutation testing for 2x2
		contingency tables. Motivated by testing for disease
		association with rare genetic variants in case-control studies.
		When variants are extremely rare, these tests give better
		control of Type I error than standard tests.
