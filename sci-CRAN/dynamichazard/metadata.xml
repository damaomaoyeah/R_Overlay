		Dynamic Hazard Models using State Space Models // Contains
		functions that lets you fit dynamic hazard models with binary
		outcomes using state space models. The methods are originally
		described in Fahrmeir (1992) doi:10.1080/01621459.1992.10475232
		and Fahrmeir (1994) doi:10.1093/biomet/81.2.317. The functions
		also provide an extension hereof where the Extended Kalman
		filter is replaced by an Unscented Kalman filter. Models are
		fitted with the regular coxph() like formula.
