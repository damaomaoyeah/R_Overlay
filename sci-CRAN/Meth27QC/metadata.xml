		Meth27QC: sample quality analysis, and sample control analysis //
		Meth27QC is a tool for analyzing Illumina Infinium
		HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Data and generating QC reports.
		This package allows users quickly assess data quality of the
		Assay. Users can evaluate the data quality in the way that
		Illumina GenomeStudio/BeadStudio recommended based on the
		control probes. The package reads files exported from
		GenomeStudio/BeadStudio software, generating intensity and
		standard deviation plots grouped by the types of the control
		probes. Meth27 carries 40 control probes for staining,
		hybridization, target removal, extension, bisulfite conversion,
		specificity, negative and non-polymorphic controls. Details of
		those control probes can be found in the Infinium Assay for
		Methylation Protocol Guide from Illumina.We also used the other
		non-control probes to plot intensity of detected genes, signal
		average for green and red. Outliers can be identified.
