		Joint Analysis of Genotype and Group-Specific Variability Using a
		Novel Score Test Approach to Map Expression Quantitative Trait
		Loci (eQTL) // Implements a novel score test that measures 1)
		the overall shift in the gene expression due to genotype
		(additive genetic effect), and 2) group-specific changes in
		gene expression due to genotype (interaction effect) in a
		mixed-effects model framework.
