		Detecting Simpson's Paradox // This package detects instances of
		Simpson's Paradox in datasets. It examines subpopulations in
		the data, either user-defined or by means of cluster analysis,
		to test whether a regression at the level of the group is in
		the opposite direction at the level of subpopulations.
