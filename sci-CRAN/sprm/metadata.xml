		Sparse and Non-Sparse Partial Robust M Regression and
		Classification // Robust dimension reduction methods for
		regression and discriminant analysis are implemented that yield
		estimates with a partial least squares alike interpretability.
		Partial robust M regression (PRM) is robust to both vertical
		outliers and leverage points. Sparse partial robust M
		regression (SPRM) is a related robust method with sparse
		coefficient estimate, and therefore with intrinsic variable
		selection. For bianry classification related discriminant
		methods are PRM-DA and SPRM-DA.
