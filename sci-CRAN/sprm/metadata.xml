		Sparse and Non-Sparse Partial Robust M Regression // Robust
		methods for dimension reduction and regression analysis are
		implemented that yield estimates with a partial least squares
		alike interpretability. Partial robust M regression is robust
		to both vertical outliers and leverage points. Sparse partial
		robust M regression is a related robust method with sparse
		coefficient estimate, and therefore with intrinsic variable
		selection.
