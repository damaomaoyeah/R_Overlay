		Simultaneous Confidence Bands for the Mean of Functional Data //
		This package implements statistical methods for estimating and
		inferring the mean of functional data. The methods are based on
		simultaneous confidence bands and local polynomial fitting.
		They feature: bandwidth selection by plug-in and cross-
		validation, goodness-of-fit tests for parametric models,
		equality tests for two-sample problems, and plotting functions.
