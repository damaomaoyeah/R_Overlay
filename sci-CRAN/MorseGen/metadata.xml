		Simple raw data generator based on user-specified summary
		statistics. // MorseGen is a program for generating raw data
		based on user-specified summary (descriptive) statistics.
		Samples based on the supplied statistics are drawn from a
		normal distribution (or, in some cases, an exponential
		distribution) and scaled to match the desired descriptive
		statistics. Intended uses include creating raw data that fits
		desired characteristics or to replicate the results in a
		published study.
