		Stellar CharactEristics Pisa Estimation gRid for Binary Systems
		// SCEPtER pipeline for estimating the stellar age for double-
		lined detached binary systems. The observational constraints
		adopted in the recovery are the effective temperature, the
		metallicity [Fe/H], the mass, and the radius of the two stars.
		The results are obtained adopting a maximum likelihood
		technique over a grid of pre-computed stellar models.
