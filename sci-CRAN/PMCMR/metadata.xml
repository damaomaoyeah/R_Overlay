		Calculate Pairwise Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums // The
		Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks or van
		der Waerden's normal score test can be employed, if the data do
		not meet the assumptions for one-way ANOVA. Provided that
		significant differences were detected by the omnibus test, one
		may be interested in applying post-hoc tests for pairwise
		multiple comparisons (such as Nemenyi's test, Dunn's test,
		Conover's test, van der Waerden's test). Similarly, one-way
		ANOVA with repeated measures that is also referred to as ANOVA
		with unreplicated block design can also be conducted via the
		Friedman-Test or the Quade-test. The consequent post-hoc
		pairwise multiple comparison tests according to Nemenyi,
		Conover and Quade are also provided in this package. Finally
		Durbin's test for a two-way balanced incomplete block design
		(BIBD) is also given in this package.
