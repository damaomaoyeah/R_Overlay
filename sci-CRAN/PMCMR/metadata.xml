		Calculate Pairwise Multiple Comparisons of Mean Rank Sums // The
		Kruskal and Wallis one-way analysis of variance by ranks can be
		employed, if the data do not meet the assumptions for one-way
		ANOVA. Provided that significant differences were detected by
		the Kruskal-Wallis-Test, one may be interested in applying
		post-hoc tests for pairwise multiple comparisons of the ranked
		data. Similarly, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures that is
		also referred to as ANOVA with unreplicated block design can
		also be conducted via the Friedman-Test. The consequent post-
		hoc pairwise multiple comparison test according to Nemenyi is
		also provided in this package.
