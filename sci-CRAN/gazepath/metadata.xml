		Gazepath Transforms Eye-Tracking Data into Fixations and Saccades
		// Eye-tracking data must be transformed into fixations and
		saccades before it can be analyzed. This package provides a
		non-parametric speed-based approach to do this on a trial
		basis. The method is especially useful when there are large
		differences in data quality, as the thresholds are adjusted
		accordingly. The same pre-processing procedure can be applied
		to all participants, while accounting for individual
		differences in data quality.
