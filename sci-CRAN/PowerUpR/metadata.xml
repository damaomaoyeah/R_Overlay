		Power Analysis Tools for Individual/Cluster Randomized Trials //
		Statistical power analysis tools for designing individual or
		cluster randomized trials. Includes functions to calculate
		statistical power (1 - type II error), minimum detectable
		effect size (MDES), minimum required sample size (MRSS),
		functions to solve constrained optimal sample allocation (COSA)
		problems, and to visualize duo or trio relationships between
		statistical power, MDES, MRSS, and COSA.
