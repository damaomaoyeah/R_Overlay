		Power Analysis Tools for Multilevel Randomized Experiments //
		Statistical power analysis tools for designing multilevel
		randomized experiments. Includes functions to calculate
		statistical power (1 - type II error), minimum detectable
		effect size (MDES), minimum required sample size (MRSS),
		functions to solve constrained optimal sample allocation (COSA)
		problems, and to visualize duo or trio relationships between
		statistical power, MDES, MRSS, and a component of COSA.
