		An Ensemble Method for Combining Subset-Specific Algorithm Fits
		// Subsemble is a general subset ensemble prediction method,
		which can be used for small, moderate, or large datasets.
		Subsemble partitions the full dataset into subsets of
		observations, fits a specified underlying algorithm on each
		subset, and uses a unique form of V-fold cross-validation to
		output a prediction function that combines the subset-specific
		fits. An oracle result provides a theoretical performance
		guarantee for Subsemble.
