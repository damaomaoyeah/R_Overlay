		Regularized Linear Models // Algorithms for fitting model-based
		penalized coefficient paths. Currently the models include
		penalized Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson and
		zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. The
		penalties include least absolute shrinkage and selection
		operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD)
		and minimax concave penalty (MCP), and each possibly combining
		with L_2 penalty.
