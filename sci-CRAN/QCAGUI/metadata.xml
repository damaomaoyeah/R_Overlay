		QCA Graphical User Interface // QCAGUI is a graphical user
		interface (GUI) for the QCA package, derived from R Commander.
		Because QCA has little to do with statistics, the menus from
		Rcmdr were stripped down to the very basics.  In crisp sets
		QCA, data is binary therefore it is fairly decent to treat it
		as categorical (1 - presence; 0 - absence).  In order to ease
		the primary analysis (e.g. tables of frequencies) and the
		creation of basic graphs, this package activates some menus
		that are not available in Rcmdr but for factors. Users should
		be aware, however, that QCAGUI is not a package for statistics;
		Rcmdr is better suited for this purpose.
