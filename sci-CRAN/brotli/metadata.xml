		A Compression Format Optimized for the Web // A lossless
		compressed data format that compresses data using a combination
		of the LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding, with efficiency
		comparable to the best currently available general-purpose
		compression methods. Brotli is similar in speed to deflate but
		offers more dense compression.
