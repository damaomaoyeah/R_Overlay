		Shape Constrained Additive Models // Routines for generalized
		additive modelling under shape constraints on the component
		functions of the linear predictor (Pya and Wood, 2015)
		doi:10.1007/s11222-013-9448-7. Models can contain multiple
		shape constrained (univariate and/or bivariate) and
		unconstrained terms. The routines of gam() in package 'mgcv'
		are used for setting up the model matrix, printing and plotting
		the results.  Penalized likelihood maximization based on
		Newton-Raphson method is used to fit a model with multiple
		smoothing parameter selection by GCV or UBRE/AIC.
