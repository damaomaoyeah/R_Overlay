		Fast and Stable Estimation of the Probability of Informed Trading
		(PIN) // Utilities for fast and stable estimation of the
		probability of informed trading (PIN) in the model introduced
		by Easley et al. (2002) DOI:10.1111/1540-6261.00493 are
		implemented. Since the basic model developed by Easley et al.
		(1996) DOI:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb04074.x is nested in the
		former due to equating the intensity of uninformed buys and
		sells, functionalities can also be applied to this simpler
		model structure, if needed.
