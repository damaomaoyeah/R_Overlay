		Fast and Stable Estimation of the Probability of Informed Trading
		(PIN) // Utilities for fast and stable estimation of the
		probability of informed trading (PIN) in the model introduced
		by Easley et al. (2002) DOI:10.1111/1540-6261.00493 are
		implemented. Since the basic model developed by Easley et al.
		(1996) DOI:10.1111/j.1540-6261.1996.tb04074.x is nested in the
		former due to equating the intensity of uninformed buys and
		sells, functions can also be applied to this simpler model
		structure, if needed. State-of-the-art factorization of the
		model likelihood function as well as most recent algorithms for
		generating initial values for optimization routines are
		implemented. In total, two likelihood factorizations and three
		methodologies for starting values are included. Furthermore,
		functions for simulating datasets of daily aggregated buys and
		sells, calculating confidence intervals for the probability of
		informed trading and posterior probabilities of trading days'
		conditions are available.
