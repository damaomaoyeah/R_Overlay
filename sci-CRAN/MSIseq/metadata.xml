		Assess Tumor Microsatellite Instability with a Decision Tree
		Classifier from Exome Somatic Mutations // A decision tree
		classifier for detecting microsatellite instability (MSI) in
		somatic mutation data from whole exome sequencing. MSI is
		detected based on different mutation rates in all sites as well
		as in simple sequence repeats. This mechanism can also be
		applied to sequence data of targeted gene panels with shorter
		sequence length.
