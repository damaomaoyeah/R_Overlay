		Sequential and Batch Change Detection Using Parametric and
		Nonparametric Methods // Sequential and batch change detection
		for univariate data streams, using the change point model
		framework. Functions are provided to allow nonparametric
		distribution-free change detection in the mean, variance, or
		general distribution of a given sequence of observations.
		Parametric change detection methods are also provided for
		Gaussian, Bernoulli and Exponential sequences. Both the batch
		(Phase I) and sequential (Phase II) settings are supported, and
		the sequences may contain either a single or multiple change
		points.
