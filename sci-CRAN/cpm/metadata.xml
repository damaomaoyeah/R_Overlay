		Sequential and Batch Change Detection Using Parametric and
		Nonparametric Methods // Sequential and batch change detection
		for univariate data streams, using the change point model
		framework. Functions are provided to allow the parametric
		monitoring of sequences of Gaussian, Bernoulli and Exponential
		random variables, along with functions implementing more
		general nonparametric methods for monitoring sequences which
		have an unspecified or unknown distribution.
