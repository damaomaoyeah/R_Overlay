		Warnes and Raftery's MCGibbsit MCMC diagnostic // 'mcgibbsit'
		provides an implementation of Warnes  Raftery's MCGibbsit run-
		length diagnostic for a set of (not-necessarily independent)
		MCMC samplers.  It combines the estimate error-bounding
		approach of the Raftery and Lewis MCMC run length diagnostic
		with the between verses within chain approach of the Gelman and
		Rubin MCMC convergence diagnostic.
