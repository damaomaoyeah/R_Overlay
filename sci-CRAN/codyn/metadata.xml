		Community Dynamics Metrics // A toolbox of ecological community
		dynamics metrics that are explicitly temporal. Functions fall
		into two categories: temporal diversity indices and community
		stability metrics. The diversity indices are temporal analogs
		to traditional diversity indices such as richness and rank-
		abundance curves. Specifically, functions are provided to
		calculate species turnover, mean rank shifts, and lags in
		community similarity between time points. The community
		stability metrics calculate overall stability and patterns of
		species covariance and synchrony over time.
