		Model Tropical Cyclone Wind Speeds // Allows users to input
		tracking data for a hurricane or other tropical storm, along
		with a data frame of grid points at which to model wind speeds.
		Functions in this package will then calculate wind speeds at
		each point based on wind model equations. This modeling
		framework is currently set up to model winds for North American
		locations with Atlantic basin storms. This work was supported
		in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental
		Health Sciences (R00ES022631), the National Science Foundation
		(1331399), and the Department of Energy (DE-FG02-08ER64644).
