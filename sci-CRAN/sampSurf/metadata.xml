		Sampling Surface Simulation for Areal Sampling Methods //
		Sampling surface simulation is useful in the comparison of
		different areal sampling methods in forestry, ecology and
		natural resources. The sampSurf package allows the simulation
		of numerous sampling methods for standing trees and downed
		woody debris in a spatial context. It also provides an S4 class
		and method structure that facilitates the addition of new
		sampling methods.
