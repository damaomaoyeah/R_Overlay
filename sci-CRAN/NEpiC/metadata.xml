		Network Assisted Algorithm for Epigenetic Studies Using Mean and
		Variance Combined Signals // Package for a Network assisted
		algorithm for Epigenetic studies using mean and variance
		Combined signals: NEpiC. NEpiC combines both signals in mean
		and variance differences in methylation level between case and
		control groups searching for differentially methylated sub-
		networks (modules) using the protein-protein interaction
		network.
