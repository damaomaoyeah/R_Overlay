		that primarily produce graphics to aid in a Propensity Score
		Analysis (PSA).  Functions include: cat.psa and box.psa to test
		balance within strata of categorical and quantitative
		covariates, circ.psa for a representation of the estimated
		effect size by stratum, loess.psa that provides a graphic and
		loess based effect size estimate, and various balance functions
		that provide measures of the balance achieved via a PSA in a
		categorical covariate.
