		Optimal Block Designs for Two-Colour cDNA Microarray Experiments
		// Computes A-, MV-, D- and E-optimal or near-optimal block
		designs for two-colour cDNA microarray experiments using the
		linear fixed effects and mixed effects models where the
		interest is in a comparison of all possible elementary
		treatment contrasts. The algorithms used in this package are
		based on the treatment exchange and array exchange algorithms
		of Debusho, Gemechu and Haines (2016, unpublished). The package
		also provides an optional method of using the graphical user
		interface (GUI) R package tcltk to ensure that it is user
		friendly.
