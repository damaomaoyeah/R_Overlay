		Default Color Maps from 'matplotlib' (Lite Version) // Port of
		the new 'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the default -,
		'magma', 'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib'
		http://matplotlib.org/  is a popular plotting library for
		'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that they
		will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in
		regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. They
		are also designed to be perceived by readers with the most
		common form of color blindness. This is the 'lite' version of
		the more complete 'viridis' package that can be found at
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis.
