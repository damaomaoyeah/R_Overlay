		Weighted Effect Coding // Provides functions to create factor
		variables with contrasts based on weighted effect coding, and
		their interactions. In weighted effect coding the estimates
		from a first order regression model show the deviations per
		group from the sample mean. This is especially useful when a
		researcher has no directional hypotheses and uses a sample from
		a population in which the number of observation per group is
		different.
