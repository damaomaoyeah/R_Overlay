		Efficient Estimation of Covariance and (Partial) Correlation //
		Implements a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator for the
		covariance matrix, with separate shrinkage for variances and
		correlations. The details of the method are explained in
		Sch\"afer and Strimmer (2005) and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer
		(2007).  The approach is both computationally as well as
		statistically very efficient, it is applicable to "small n,
		large p" data, and always returns a positive definite and well-
		conditioned covariance matrix. In addition to inferring the
		covariance matrix the package also provides shrinkage
		estimators for partial correlations and partial variances. The
		inverse of the covariance and correlation matrix can be
		efficiently computed, as well as any arbitrary power of the
		shrinkage correlation matrix.  Furthermore, functions are
		available for fast singular value decomposition, for computing
		the pseudoinverse, and for checking the rank and positive
		definiteness of a matrix.
