		Natural disaster losses for the USA from the SHELDUS database //
		The Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database in the United
		States (SHELDUS, http://www.sheldus.org), from the University
		of South Carolina, is a database on human and property losses
		from natural disasters in the United States. This database
		includes County-level information on property losses, crop
		losses, injuries and fatalities from 18 different types of
		natural hazards from about 1960 to the present. Although the
		data is free, downloading the data is tedious and so is
		cleaning and analysing it. This package comes with the entire
		SHELDUS data and includes functionality for data extraction and
		analysis.
