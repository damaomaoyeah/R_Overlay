		Vertical and Horizontal Inheritance Consistence Analysis // The
		"Vertical and Horizontal Inheritance Consistence Analysis"
		method is described in the following publication: "VHICA: a new
		method to discriminate between vertical and horizontal
		transposon transfer: application to the mariner family within
		Drosophila" by G. Wallau. et al. (2016)
		DOI:10.1093/molbev/msv341. The purpose of the method is to
		detect horizontal transfers of transposable elements, by
		contrasting the divergence of transposable element sequences
		with that of regular genes.
