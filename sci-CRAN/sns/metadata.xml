		Stochastic Newton Sampler (SNS) // Stochastic Newton Sampler
		(SNS) is a Metropolis-Hastings-based, Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		sampler for twice differentiable, log-concave probability
		densities where the proposal density function is a multivariate
		Gaussian resulting from a second-order Taylor-series expansion
		of log-density around the current point. The mean of the
		Gaussian proposal is the full Newton-Raphson step from the
		current point. A boolean flag allows for switching from SNS to
		Newton-Raphson optimization (by choosing the mean of proposal
		function as next point). This can be used during burn-in to get
		close to the mode of the pdf (which is unique due to
		concavity). For high-dimensional densities, mixing can be
		improved via 'state space partitioning' strategy, in which SNS
		is applied to disjoint subsets of state space, wrapped in a
		Gibbs cycle.
