		Density Estimation with Soft Information by Exponential Epi-
		splines // Produce one-dimensional density estimates using
		exponential epi-splines. The user may incorporate soft
		information, by imposing constraints that (i) require
		unimodality; (ii) require that the density be monotone non-
		increase or non-decreasing; (iii) put upper bounds on first or
		second moments; (iv) bound the density's values at mesh points;
		(v) require that the estimate be continuous or continuously
		differentiable; and more.
