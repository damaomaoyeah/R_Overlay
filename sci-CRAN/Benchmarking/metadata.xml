		Benchmark and Frontier Analysis Using DEA and SFA // The
		Benchmarking package contains methods for frontier analysis. It
		supports Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) under different
		technology assumptions (fdh, vrs, drs, crs, irs, add/frh, and
		fdh+), and using different efficiency measures (input based,
		output based, hyperbolic graph, additive, super, and
		directional efficiency). Peers and slacks are available,
		partial price information can be included, and optimal cost,
		revenue and profit can be calculated. Evaluation of mergers is
		also supported.  Methods for graphing the technology sets are
		also included. The package also support comparative methods
		based on Stochastic Frontier Analyses (SFA). In general, the
		methods can be used to solve not only standard models, but also
		many other model variants. The package complements the book,
		Bogetoft and Otto, Benchmarking with DEA, SFA, and R, Springer-
		Verlag, 2011, but can of course also be used as a stand-alone
		package.
