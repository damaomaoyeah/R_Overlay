		R Simple Image Mosaic Creation Library // Provides a way to
		transform an image into a mosaic composed from a set of smaller
		images (tiles). It also contains a simple function for creating
		the tiles from a folder of images directly through R, without
		the need of any external code. At this moment only the JPEG
		format is supported, either as input (image and tiles) or
		output (mosaic transformed image).
