		Categorical Landscape Simulation Facility // Simulates
		categorical maps on actual geographical realms, starting from
		either empty landscapes or landscapes provided by the user
		(e.g. land use maps). Allows to tweak or create landscapes
		while retaining a high degree of control on its features,
		without the hassle of specifying each location attribute. In
		this it differs from other tools which generate null or neutral
		landscapes in a theoretical space. The basic algorithm
		currently implemented uses a simple agent style/cellular
		automata growth model, with no rules (apart from areas of
		exclusion) and von Neumann neighbourhood (four cells, aka Rook
		case). Outputs are raster dataset exportable to any common GIS
		format.
