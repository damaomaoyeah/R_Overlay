		Categorical Landscape Simulation Facilities // Package is aimed
		at simulating categorical maps on actual geographical realms,
		starting from either empty landscapes, or landscapes provided
		by the user (e.g. land use maps). landscapeR allows to tweak or
		create landscapes while retaining a high degree of control on
		its features, without the hassle of specifying each location
		attribute. In this it differs from other tools which generate
		null or neutral landscape in a theoretical space. The basic
		algorithm currently implemented uses a simple agent
		style/cellular automata growth model, with no rules (apart from
		areas of exclusion). Outputs are raster dataset exportable to
		any common GIS format.
