		Categorical Landscape Simulation Facility // This set of
		functions allows the simulation of categorical maps from
		scratch in a geographically referenced landscape or the
		manipulation of existing ones. The basic algorithm currently
		implemented uses a simple agent style/cellular automata growth
		model, with no rules (apart from areas of exclusion), therefore
		expands more or less circularly picking cells at the edges
		randomly.
