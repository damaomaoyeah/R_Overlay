		Enhanced Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series by Loess //
		Decompose a time series into seasonal, trend, and remainder
		components using an implementation of Seasonal Decomposition of
		Time Series by Loess (STL) that provides several enhancements
		over the STL method in the stats package.  These enhancements
		include handling missing values, providing higher order
		(quadratic) loess smoothing with automated parameter choices,
		frequency component smoothing beyond the seasonal and trend
		components, and some basic plot methods for diagnostics.
