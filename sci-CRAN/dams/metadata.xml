		Dams in the United States from the National Inventory of Dams
		(NID) // The single largest source of dams in the United States
		is the National Inventory of Dams (NID,
		http://nid.usace.army.mil) from the US Army Corps of Engineers.
		Entire data from the NID cannot be obtained all at once and
		NID's website limits extraction of more than a couple of
		thousand records at a time. Moreover, selected data from the
		NID's user interface cannot not be saved to a file. In order to
		make the analysis of this data easier, all the data from NID
		was extracted manually. Subsequently, the raw data was checked
		for potential errors and cleaned. This package provides sample
		cleaned data from the NID and provides functionality to access
		the entire cleaned NID data.
