		Optimal Binning for Scoring Modeling // It categorizes a numeric
		variable into bins mapped to a binary target variable for its
		ulterior usage in scoring modeling. Its purpose is to automate
		the time consuming process of selecting the right cut points,
		quickly calculate metrics such as Weight of Evidence and
		Information Value; and also document SQL codes, tables, and
		plots used throughout the development stage. The package also
		allows users to establish their own cut points for numeric
		characteristics and run the analysis for categorical variables.
