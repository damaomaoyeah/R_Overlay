		Optimal Binning for Scoring Modeling // The main purpose of the
		package is to categorize a numeric variable into bins mapped to
		a binary target variable for its ulterior usage in scoring
		modeling. This functionality reduces dramatically the time
		consuming process of finding the optimal cut points for a given
		numeric variable, quickly calculates the Information Value,
		either for one variable at the time or all at once in one line
		of code; and also outputs 'SQL' codes, tables, and plots used
		throughout the development stage. The package also allows the
		user to understand the data via exploratory data analysis in
		one step, establish customized cut points for numeric
		characteristics, and run the analysis for categorical
		variables.
