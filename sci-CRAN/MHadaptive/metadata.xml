		General Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inference using
		adaptive Metropolis-Hastings sampling // Performs general
		Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of a user
		defined function which returns the un-normalized value
		(likelihood times prior) of a Bayesian model.  The proposal
		variance-covariance structure is updated adaptively for
		efficient mixing when the structure of the target distribution
		is unknown.  The package also provides some functions for
		Bayesian inference including Bayesian Credible Intervals (BCI)
		and Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) calculation.
