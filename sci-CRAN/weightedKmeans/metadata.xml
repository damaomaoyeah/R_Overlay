		Weighted KMeans Clustering // Entropy weighted kmeans (ewkm) is a
		weighted subspace clustering algorithm that is well suited to
		very high dimensional data. Weights are calculated as the
		importance of a variable with regard to cluster membership. The
		feature group weighted kmenas (fgkm) extends this concept by
		grouping features and weighting the group in addition to
		weihgting individual features.
