		Hierarchical Climate Regionalization // A tool for Hierarchical
		Climate Regionalization applicable to any correlation-based
		clustering. It adds several features and a new clustering
		method (called, 'regional' linkage) to hierarchical clustering
		in R ('hclust' function in 'stats' library): data regridding,
		coarsening spatial resolution, geographic masking (by
		continents, regions, or countries), data filtering by mean
		and/or variance thresholds, data preprocessing (detrending,
		standardization, and PCA), faster correlation function with
		preliminary big data support, different clustering methods,
		hybrid hierarchical clustering, multi-variate clustering (MVC),
		cluster validation, and visualization of region maps.
