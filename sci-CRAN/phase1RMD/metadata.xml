		Repeated Measurement Design for Phase I Clinical Trial //
		Implements our Bayesian phase I repeated measurement design
		that accounts for multidimensional toxicity endpoints from
		multiple treatment cycles. The package also provides a novel
		design to account for both multidimensional toxicity endpoints
		and early-stage efficacy endpoints in the phase I design. For
		both designs, functions are provided to recommend the next
		dosage selection based on the data collected in the available
		patient cohorts and to simulate trial characteristics given
		design parameters. Yin, Jun, et al. (2017)
