		Accessing, subsetting and plotting mouse SNPs. // This package
		queries the SNPs data sets and makes plots of genes and SNPs.
		This package allows users to access these data sets once they
		have been compiled into one file and indexed with Tabix
		(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/tabix.shtml). There are
		functions to retrieve SNPs, subset them for specific strains,
		obtain only SNPs that are polymorphic for a subset of strains,
		plot SNPs and look for certain allele patterns in SNPs. We have
		also added functions to access indels and structural variants.
