		Ensemble of Subset of K-Nearest Neighbours Classifiers for
		Classification and Class Membership Probability Estimation //
		Functions for classification and group membership probability
		estimation are given. The issue of non-informative features in
		the data is addressed by utilizing the ensemble method. A few
		optimal models are selected in the ensemble from an initially
		large set of base k-nearest neighbours (KNN) models, generated
		on subset of features from the training data. A two stage
		assessment  is applied in selection of optimal models for the
		ensemble in the training function. The prediction functions for
		classification and class membership probability estimation
		returns class outcomes and class membership probability
		estimates for the test data. The package includes measure of
		classification error and brier score, for classification and
		probability estimation tasks respectively.
