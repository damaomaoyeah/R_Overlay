		A Flexible Syntax for Population Dynamic Modelling // Population
		dynamic models underpin a range of analyses and applications in
		ecology and epidemiology. The various approaches for analysing
		population dynamics models (MPMs, IPMs, ODEs, POMPs, PVA) each
		require the model to be defined in a different way. This makes
		it difficult to combine different modelling approaches and data
		types to solve a given problem. 'pop' aims to provide a
		flexible and easy to use common interface for constructing
		population dynamic models and enabling to them to be fitted and
		analysed in lots of different ways.
