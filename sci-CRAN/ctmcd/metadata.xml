		Estimating the Parameters of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain from
		Discrete-Time Data // Functions for estimating Markov generator
		matrices from discrete-time observations. The implemented
		approaches comprise diagonal adjustment, weighted adjustment
		and quasi-optimization of matrix logarithm based candidate
		solutions, an expectation-maximization algorithm as well as a
		Gibbs sampler.
