		Package for Community Ecology and Suitability Analysis //
		Graphical User Interface (via the R-Commander) and utility
		functions (often based on the vegan package) for statistical
		analysis of biodiversity and ecological communities, including
		species accumulation curves, diversity indices, Renyi profiles,
		GLMs for analysis of species abundance and presence-absence,
		distance matrices, Mantel tests, and cluster, constrained and
		unconstrained ordination analysis. A book on biodiversity and
		community ecology analysis is available for free download from
		the website. In 2012, methods for (ensemble) suitability
		modelling and mapping were expanded in the package.
