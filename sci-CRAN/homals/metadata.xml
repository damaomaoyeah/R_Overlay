		Gifi Methods for Optimal Scaling // Performs a homogeneity
		analysis (multiple correspondence analysis) and various
		extensions. Rank restrictions on the category quantifications
		can be imposed (nonlinear PCA). The categories are transformed
		by means of optimal scaling with options for nominal, ordinal,
		and numerical scale levels (for rank-1 restrictions). Variables
		can be grouped into sets, in order to emulate regression
		analysis and canonical correlation analysis.
