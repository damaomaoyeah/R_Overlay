		An Implementation of Deep Neural Network for Regression and
		Classification // An implementation of deep neural network with
		rectifier linear units trained with stochastic gradient descent
		method and batch normalization. A combination of these methods
		have achieved state-of-the-art performance in ImageNet
		classification by overcoming the gradient saturation problem
		experienced by many deep architecture neural network models in
		the past. In addition, batch normalization and dropout are
		implemented as a means of regularization. The deeplearning
		package is inspired by the darch package and uses its class
		DArch.
