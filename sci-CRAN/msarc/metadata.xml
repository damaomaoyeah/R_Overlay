		Draw Diagrams (mis)Representing the Results of Mass Spec
		Experiments // The output of an affinity-purification mass
		spectrometry experiment is typically a list of proteins that
		were observed in the experiment, identified by UniProt
		identifiers (http://www.uniprot.org/).  This package takes as
		input a list of UniProt identifiers, and the associated Mascot
		scores from the experiment (which indicate the likelihood that
		the protein has been correctly identified), clusters them by
		gene ontology category (http://geneontology.org/), then draws
		diagrams showing the results in hierarchical clusters by
		category, with lines for individual proteins representing the
		associated Mascot score. The results are in general not
		publication-ready, but will rather require editing via a
		graphics editor that can interpret SVG (scalable vector
		graphics) format.  As an alternative representation, the
		package will also generate tag clouds based on the Mascot
		scores.
