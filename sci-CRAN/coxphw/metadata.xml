		Weighted Estimation in Cox Regression // This package implements
		weighted estimation in Cox regression as proposed by Schemper,
		Wakounig and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009). Weighted
		Cox regression provides unbiased average hazard ratio estimates
		also in case of non-proportional hazards. Approximated
		generalized concordance probability an effect size measure for
		clear-cut decisions can be obtained. Additionally estimation of
		nonlinear effects using fractional polynomials similar to the
		MFP algorithm (Royston, Sauerbrei, 2008) is provided. This
		feature can also be used to estimate the interaction of a
		covariate with a nonlinear function of time.
