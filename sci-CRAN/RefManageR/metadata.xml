		Straightforward 'BibTeX' and 'BibLaTeX' Bibliography Management
		// Provides tools for importing and working with bibliographic
		references. It greatly enhances the 'bibentry' class by
		providing a class 'BibEntry' which stores 'BibTeX' and
		'BibLaTeX' references, supports 'UTF-8' encoding, and can be
		easily searched by any field, by date ranges, and by various
		formats for name lists (author by last names, translator by
		full names, etc.). Entries can be updated, combined, sorted,
		printed in a number of styles, and exported. 'BibTeX' and
		'BibLaTeX' '.bib' files can be read into 'R' and converted to
		'BibEntry' objects. Interfaces to 'NCBI Entrez', 'CrossRef',
		and 'Zotero' are provided for importing references and
		references can be created from locally stored 'PDF' files using
		'Poppler'. Includes functions for citing and generating a
		bibliography with hyperlinks for documents prepared with
		'RMarkdown' or 'RHTML'.
