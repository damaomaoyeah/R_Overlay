		A package to estimate posterior probabilities and perform model
		selection in change-point models using constrained HMM. // The
		functions are used for change-point problems, after an initial
		set of change-points within the data has already been obtained.
		The function postCP obtains estimates of posterior
		probabilities of change-point and hidden states for each
		observation, and confidence intervals for the positions of the
		change-point. The function postCPsample obtains random samples
		of sets of change-points using the output of the postCP
		function. Model selection may be performed using function
		postCPmodelsel through criteria obtained from function
		postCPcrit.
