		Manage Time Series with R and PostgreSQL // Store and organize a
		large amount of low frequency time series data. The package was
		designed to manage a large catalog of official statistics which
		are typically published on monthly, quarterly or yearly basis.
		Thus timeseriesdb is optimized to handle a large number of
		lower frequency time series as opposed to a smaller amount of
		high frequency time series such as real time data from
		measuring devices. Hence timeseriesdb provides the opportunity
		to store extensive multi-lingual meta information. The package
		also provides a web GUI to explore the underlying PostgreSQL
		database interactively.
