		Partial Correlation Coefficient with Information Theory // Apply
		Partial Correlation coefficient with Information Theory (PCIT)
		to a correlation matrix. The PCIT algorithm identifies
		meaningful correlations to define edges in a weighted network.
		The algorithm can be applied to any correlation-based network
		including but not limited to gene co-expression networks. To
		reduce compute time by making use of multiple compute cores,
		simply run PCIT on a computer with has multiple cores and also
		has the Rmpi package installed. PCIT will then auto-detect the
		multicore environment and run in parallel mode without the need
		to rewrite your scripts. This makes scripts, using PCIT,
		portable across single core (or no Rmpi package installed)
		computers which will run in serial mode and multicore (with
		Rmpi package installed) computers which will run in parallel
		mode.
