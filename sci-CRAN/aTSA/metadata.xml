		Alternative Time Series Analysis // Contains some tools for
		testing, analyzing time series data and fitting popular time
		series models such as ARIMA, Moving Average and Holt Winters,
		etc. Most functions also provide nice and clear outputs like
		SAS does, such as identify, estimate and forecast, which are
		the same statements in PROC ARIMA in SAS.
