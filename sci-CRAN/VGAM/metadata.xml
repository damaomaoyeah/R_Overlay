		Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models // An
		implementation of about 6 major classes of statistical
		regression models. At the heart of it are the vector
		generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes, and
		the book "Vector Generalized Linear and Additive Models: With
		an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015) gives details of the
		statistical framework and VGAM package. Currently only fixed-
		effects models are implemented, i.e., no random-effects models.
		Many (150+) models and distributions are estimated by maximum
		likelihood estimation (MLE) or penalized MLE, using Fisher
		scoring. VGLMs can be loosely thought of as multivariate GLMs.
		VGAMs are data-driven VGLMs (i.e., with smoothing). The other
		classes are RR-VGLMs (reduced-rank VGLMs), quadratic RR-VGLMs,
		reduced-rank VGAMs, RCIMs (row-column interaction
		models)---these classes perform constrained and unconstrained
		quadratic ordination (CQO/UQO) models in ecology, as well as
		constrained additive ordination (CAO). Note that these
		functions are subject to change; see the NEWS and ChangeLog
		files for latest changes.
