		soilwater: Implements parametric formulas for soil water
		retention or conductivity curve // It contains implementations
		of parametric formulas for soil water retention or conductivity
		curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten (for soil water
		retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity) were
		implemented. See reference
		\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_retention_curve}. Any
		contributions or suggestions are warmly welcomed.
