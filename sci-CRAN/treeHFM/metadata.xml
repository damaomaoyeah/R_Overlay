		Hidden Factor Graph Models // Hidden Factor graph models
		generalise Hidden Markov Models to tree structured data. The
		distinctive feature of 'treeHFM' is that it learns a transition
		matrix for first order (sequential) and for second order
		(splitting) events. It can be applied to all discrete and
		continuous data that is structured as a binary tree. In the
		case of continuous observations, 'treeHFM' has Gaussian
		distributions as emissions.
