		Environment Based Clustering for Interpretable Predictive Models
		in High Dimensional Data // Companion package to the paper: An
		analytic approach for interpretable predictive models in high
		dimensional data, in the presence of interactions with
		exposures. Bhatnagar, Yang, Khundrakpam, Evans, Blanchette,
		Bouchard, Greenwood (2017) DOI:10.1101/102475. This package
		includes an algorithm for clustering high dimensional data that
		can be affected by an environmental factor.
