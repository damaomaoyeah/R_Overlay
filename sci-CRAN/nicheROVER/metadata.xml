		(Niche) (R)egion and Niche (Over)lap Metrics for Multidimensional
		Ecological Niches // This package uses a probabilistic method
		to calculate niche regions and pairwise niche overlap using
		multidimensional niche indicator data (e.g., stable isotopes,
		environmental variables, etc.). The niche region is defined as
		the joint probability density function of the multidimensional
		niche indicators at a user-defined probability alpha (e.g.,
		95%).  Uncertainty is accounted for in a Bayesian framework,
		and the method can be extended to three or more indicator
		dimensions.  It provides directional estimates of niche
		overlap, accounts for species-specific distributions in
		multivariate niche space, and produces unique and consistent
		bivariate projections of the multivariate niche region.  A
		forthcoming article by Swanson et al. (Ecology, 2014) provides
		a detailed description of the methodology.  See the package
		vignette for a worked example using fish stable isotope data.
