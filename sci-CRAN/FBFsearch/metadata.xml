		Algorithm for searching the space of Gaussian directed acyclic
		graphical models through moment fractional Bayes factors // We
		propose an objective Bayesian algorithm for searching the space
		of Gaussian directed acyclic graphical models when the
		variables are assumed to satisfy a given ordering. The approach
		used is based on non-local parameter priors and thus it is
		suitable for learning sparse graphs. The algorithm is
		implemented in C++ using the open-source library Armadillo.
