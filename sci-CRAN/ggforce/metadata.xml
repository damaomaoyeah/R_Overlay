		Accelerating 'ggplot2' // The aim of 'ggplot2' is to aid in
		visual data investigations. This focus has led to a lack of
		facilities for composing specialised plots. 'ggforce' aims to
		be a collection of mainly new stats and geoms that fills this
		gap. All additional functionality is aimed to come through the
		official extension system so using 'ggforce' should be a stable
		experience.
