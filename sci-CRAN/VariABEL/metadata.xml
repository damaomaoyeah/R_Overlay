		Testing of Genotypic Variance Heterogeneity to Detect Potentially
		Interacting SNP // Presence of interaction between a SNP and
		another SNP (or another factor) can result in heterogeneity of
		variance between the genotypes of an interacting SNP. Detecting
		such heterogeneity gives prior knowledge for constructing a
		genetic model underlying complex trait.
