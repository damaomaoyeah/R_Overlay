		Generate APA Tables for MS Word // Most psychological journals
		require that tables in a manuscript comply to APA (American
		Association of Psychology) standards. Creating APA tables
		manually is often time consuming and prone to transcription
		errors. This package generates tables for MS Word ('.docx'
		extension) in APA format automatically with just a few lines of
		code.
