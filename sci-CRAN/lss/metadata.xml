		the accelerated failure time model to right censored data based
		on least-squares principle // Due to lack of proper inference
		procedure and software, the ordinary linear regression model is
		seldom used in practice for the analysis of right censored
		data. This paper presents an S-Plus/R program that implements a
		recently developed inference procedure (Jin, Lin and Ying,
		2006)\cite{Jin} for the accelerated failure time model based on
		the least-squares principle.
