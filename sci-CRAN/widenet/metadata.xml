		Penalized Regression with Polynomial Basis Expansions // Extends
		the glmnet and relaxnet packages with polynomial basis
		expansions. Basis expansion is applied to the predictors and a
		subset of the basis functions is chosen using relaxnet.
		Predictors may be screened using correlation or t-tests.
		Screening is done separately within cross-validation folds.
		Cross-validation may be used to select the order of basis
		expansion and alpha, the elastic net tuning parameter.
