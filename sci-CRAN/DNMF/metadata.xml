		Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization // Discriminant
		Non-Negative Matrix Factorization aims to extend the Non-
		negative Matrix Factorization algorithm in order to extract
		features that enforce not only the spatial locality, but also
		the separability between classes in a discriminant manner. It
		refers to three article, Zafeiriou, Stefanos, et al.
		"Exploiting discriminant information in nonnegative matrix
		factorization with application to frontal face verification."
		Neural Networks, IEEE Transactions on 17.3 (2006): 683-695.

		Using dNMF for Emotion Recognition in Vowel Sounds." Neural
		Information Processing. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2013. and
