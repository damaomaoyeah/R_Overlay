		Methods for Evaluating Principal Surrogates of Treatment Response
		// Contains the core methods for the evaluation of principal
		surrogates in a single clinical trial. Provides a flexible
		interface for defining models for the risk given treatment and
		the surrogate, the models for integration over the missing
		counterfactual surrogate responses, and the estimation methods.
		Estimated maximum likelihood and pseudo-score can be used for
		estimation, and the bootstrap for inference. A variety of post-
		estimation summary methods are provided, including print,
		summary, plot, and testing.
