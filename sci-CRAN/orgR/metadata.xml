		Analyse Text Files Created by Emacs' Org mode // Provides
		functionality to process text files created by Emacs' Org mode,
		and decompose the content to the smallest components
		(headlines, body, tag, clock entries etc).  Emacs is an
		extensible, customizable text editor and Org mode is for
		keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects.
		Allows users to analyze org files as data frames in R, e.g., to
		convieniently group tasks by tag into project and calculate
		total working hours.  Also provides some help functions like
		search.parent, gg.pie (visualise working hours in ggplot2) and
		tree.headlines (visualise headline stricture in tree format) to
		help user managing their complex org files.
