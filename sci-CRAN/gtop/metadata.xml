		Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP) Reconciliation Method // In
		hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting, the hierarchical
		relation between multiple time series is exploited to make
		better forecasts. This hierarchical relation implies one or
		more aggregate consistency constraints that the series are
		known to satisfy. Many existing approaches, like for example
		bottom-up or top-down forecasting, therefore attempt to achieve
		this goal in a way that guarantees that the forecasts will also
		be aggregate consistent. This package provides with an
		implementation of the Game-Theoretically OPtimal (GTOP)
		reconciliation method proposed in van Erven and Cugliari
		(2015), which is guaranteed to only improve any given set of
		forecasts. This opens up new possibilities  for constructing
		the forecasts. For example, it is not necessary to assume that
		bottom-level forecasts are unbiased, and aggregate forecasts
		may be constructed by regressing both on bottom-level forecasts
		and on other covariates that may only be available at the
		aggregate level.
