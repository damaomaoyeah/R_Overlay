		Linear Regression Based on Linear Structure Between Covariates //
		Linear regression based on a recursive structural equation
		model (explicit multiples correlations) found by a MCMC
		algorithm. It permits to face highly correlated covariates.
		Variable selection is included (by lasso, elastic net, etc.).
		It also provides some graphical tools for basic statistics
		(Boxplot with confidence intervals, etc) and regression trees.
