		Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models // The hglm package is
		used to fit hierarchical generalized linear models. It can be
		used for linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed
		models with random effects for a variety of links and a variety
		of distributions for both the outcomes and the random effects.
		Fixed effects can also be fitted in the dispersion part of the
		mean model.
