		Distance-Based Measures of Spatial Structures // Simple
		computation of spatial statistic functions of distance to
		characterize the spatial structures of mapped objects,
		including classical ones (Ripley's K and others) and more
		recent ones used by spatial economists (Duranton and Overman's
		Kd, Marcon and Puech's M). Relies on spatstat for some core
		calculation.
