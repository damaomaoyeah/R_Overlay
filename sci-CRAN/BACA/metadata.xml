		Bubble Chart to Compare Biological Annotations by using DAVID //
		R-based graphical tool to concisely visualise and compare
		biological annotations queried from the DAVID web service. It
		provides R functions to perform enrichment analysis (via DAVID
		- http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) on several gene lists at once,
		and then visualizing all the results in one generated figure
		that allows R users to compare the annotations found for each
		list.
