		Weighting and Weighted Statistics // This package currently
		provides a variety of functions for producing simple weighted
		statistics, such as weighted Pearson's correlations, partial
		correlations, Chi-Squareds, histograms, and t-tests.  Also now
		includes some software for quickly recoding survey data.
		Future versions of the package will be more closely integrated
		with anesrake and additional weighting tools and will provide
		the option to find weighting benchmarks and weight data using a
		variety of methodologies.  NOTE: Weighted partial correlation
		calculations temporarily pulled to address a bug.
