		A Residue-Residue Contact Detecting Method // Contact prediction
		using shrinked covariance (COUSCOus). COUSCOus is a residue-
		residue contact detecting method approaching the contact
		inference using the glassofast implementation of Matyas and
		Sustik (2012, The University of Texas at Austin UTCS Technical
		Report 2012:1-3. TR-12-29.) that solves the L_1 regularised
		Gaussian maximum likelihood estimation of the inverse of a
		covariance matrix. Prior to the inverse covariance matrix
		estimation we utilise a covariance matrix shrinkage approach,
		the empirical Bayes covariance estimator, which has been shown
		by Haff (1980) DOI:10.1214/aos/1176345010 to be the best
		estimator in a Bayesian framework, especially dominating
		estimators of the form aS, such as the smoothed covariance
		estimator applied in a related contact inference technique
		PSICOV.
