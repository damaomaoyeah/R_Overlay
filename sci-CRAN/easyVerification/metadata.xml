		to simplify application of atomic forecast verification metrics
		for (comparative) verification of ensemble forecasts to large
		datasets. The forecast metrics are imported from the

		are provided with this package. Alternatively, new user-defined
		forecast scores can be implemented using the example scores
		provided and applied using the functionality of this package.
