		Bias-Corrected Bayesian Classification with Selected Features //
		Fully Bayesian Classification with a subset of high-dimensional
		features, such as expression levels of genes. The data are
		modeled with a hierarchical Bayesian models using heavy-tailed
		t distributions as priors. When a large number of features are
		available, one may like to select only a subset of features to
		use, typically those features strongly correlated with the
		response in training cases. Such a feature selection procedure
		is however invalid since the relationship between the response
		and the features has be exaggerated by feature selection. This
		package provides a way to avoid this bias and yield better-
		calibrated predictions for future cases when one uses
		F-statistic to select features.
