		Normalisation of Multiple Variables in Large-Scale Datasets //
		The robustness of many of the statistical techniques, such as
		factor analysis, applied in the social sciences rests upon the
		assumption of item-level normality. However, when dealing with
		real data, these assumptions are often not met. The Box-Cox
		transformation (Box  Cox, 1964)
		http://www.jstor.org/stable/2984418 provides an optimal
		transformation for non-normal variables. Yet, for large
		datasets of continuous variables, its application in current
		software programs is cumbersome with analysts having to take
		several steps to normalise each variable. We present an R
		package normalr that enables researchers to make convenient
		optimal transformations of multiple variables in datasets. This
		R package enables users to quickly and accurately: (1) anchor
		all of their variables at 1.00, (2) select the desired
		precision with which the optimal lambda is estimated, (3) apply
		each unique exponent to its variable, (4) rescale resultant
		values to within their original X1 and X(n) ranges, and (5)
		provide original and transformed estimates of skewness,
		kurtosis, and other inferential assessments of normality.
