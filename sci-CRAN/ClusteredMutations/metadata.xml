		Location and Visualization of Clustered Somatic Mutations //
		Identification and visualization of groups of closely spaced
		mutations in the DNA sequence of cancer genome. The extremely
		mutated zones are searched in the symmetric dissimilarity
		matrix using the anti-Robinson matrix properties. Different
		data sets are obtained to describe and plot the clustered
		mutations information.
