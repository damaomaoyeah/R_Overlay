		Simulation of Diffusion Processes // Provides the functions for
		simulating and modeling of stochastic differential equations
		(SDE's). Statistical analysis and simulation of the solution of
		SDE's enabled many searchers in different domains to use these
		equations to modeling practical problems, in financial and
		actuarial modeling and other areas of application. For example,
		modeling and simulate of dispersion in shallow water using the
		attractive center (Boukhetala K, 1996).
