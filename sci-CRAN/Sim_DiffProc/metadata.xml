		Simulation of Diffusion Processes // Provides the functions for
		simulation and modeling of stochastic differential equations
		(SDE's) the type Ito and Stratonovich. This package contains
		many objects, the numerical methods to find the solutions to
		SDE's (1, 2 and 3-dim), with a possibility for simulates a
		flows trajectories,with good accuracy. Many theoretical
		problems on the SDE's have become the object of practical
		research, as statistical analysis and simulation of solution of
		SDE's, enabled many searchers in different domains to use these
		equations to modeling and to analyse practical problems, in
		financial and actuarial modeling and other areas of
		application, for example modelling and simulate of dispersion
		in shallow water using the attractive center (Boukhetala K,
		1996).  We hope that the package presented here and the updated
		survey on the subject might be of help for practitioners,
		postgraduate and PhD students, and researchers in the field who
		might want to implement new methods.
