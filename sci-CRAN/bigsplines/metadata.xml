		Smoothing Splines for Large Samples // Fits smoothing spline
		regression models using scalable algorithms designed for large
		samples. Five marginal spline types are supported: cubic,
		different cubic, cubic periodic, cubic thin-plate, and nominal.
		Random effects and parametric effects are also supported.
		Response can be Gaussian or non-Gaussian: Binomial, Poisson,
