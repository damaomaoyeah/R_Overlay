		Spatial interpolation of genetic data // This package provides
		functions for the spatial interpolation of genetic distances
		between samples. The interpolation is based on a modified
		kriging method that accepts a genetic distance matrix and
		generates a map of probability of lineage presence. This
		package also offers tools to generate a map of potential
		contact zones between groups with user-defined thresholds in
		the tree to account for old and recent divergence.
		Additionally, it has functions for IDW interpolation using
		genetic data and midpoints.
