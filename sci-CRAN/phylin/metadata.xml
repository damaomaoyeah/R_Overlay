		Spatial Interpolation of Genetic Data // The spatial
		interpolation of genetic distances between samples is based on
		a modified kriging method that accepts a genetic distance
		matrix and generates a map of probability of lineage presence.
		This package also offers tools to generate a map of  potential
		contact zones between groups with user-defined thresholds in
		the tree to account for old and recent divergence.
		Additionally, it has functions for IDW interpolation using
		genetic data and midpoints.
