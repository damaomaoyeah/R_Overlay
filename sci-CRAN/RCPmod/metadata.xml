		Regions of common profiles modelling with mixtures-of-experts. //
		Identifies regions of common (species) profiles (RCPs).  Within
		a region the probability of sampling all species remains
		approximately constant.  This is performed using mixtures-of-
		experts models.  The package also contains associated methods,
		such as diagnostics.  Currently, the model and methods are
		defined for species presence-absence data for a number of
		sites.
