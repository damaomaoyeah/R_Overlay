		Simulating Data for PLS Mode B Structural Models // A set of
		functions have been implemented to generate random data to
		perform Monte Carlo simulations on structural models with
		formative constructs and interaction and nonlinear effects
		(Two-Step PLS Mode B structural models). The setup of the true
		model considers a simple structure with three formative
		exogenous constructs related to one formative endogenous
		construct. The routines take into account the interaction and
		nonlinear effects of the exogenous constructs on the endogenous
		construct.
