		Calculate probabilities of various dice-rolling events // This
		package provides utilities to calculate the probabilities of
		various dice-rolling events, such as the probability of rolling
		a four-sided die six times and getting a 4, a 3, and either a 1
		or 2 among the six rolls (in any order); the probability of
		rolling two six-sided dice three times and getting a 10 on the
		first roll, followed by a 4 on the second roll, followed by
		anything but a 7 on the third roll; or the probabilities of
		each possible sum of rolling five six-sided dice, dropping the
		lowest two rolls, and summing the remaining dice.
