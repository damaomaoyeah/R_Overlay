		Binary R server // Rserve acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or
		local sockets) which allows binary requests to be sent to R.
		Every connection has a separate workspace and working
		directory. Client-side implementations are available for
		popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing any
		application to use facilities of R without the need of linking
		to R code. Rserve supports remote connection, user
		authentication and file transfer. A simple R client is included
		in this package as well.
