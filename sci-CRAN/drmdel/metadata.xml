		Dual Empirical Likelihood Inference under Density Ratio Models in
		the Presence of Multiple Samples // Dual empirical likelihood
		(DEL) inference under semiparametric density ratio models (DRM)
		in the presence of multiple samples, including population
		cumulative distribution function estimation, quantile
		estimation and comparison, density estimation, composite
		hypothesis testing for DRM parameters which encompasses testing
		for changes in population distribution functions as a special
		case, etc.
