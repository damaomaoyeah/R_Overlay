		Bayesian Inference for Zero-Inflated Count Models // This package
		provides MCMC algorithms for the analysis of zero-inflated
		count models. The case of stochastic search variable selection
		(SVS) is also considered.  All MCMC samplers are coded in C++
		for improved efficiency. A data set considering the demand for
		health care is provided.
