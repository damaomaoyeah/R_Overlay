		Friendly R Startup Configuration // Adds support for R startup
		configuration via '.Renviron.d' and '.Rprofile.d' directories
		in addition to '.Renviron' and '.Rprofile' files.  This makes
		it possible to keep private / secret environment variables
		separate from other environment variables.  It also makes it
		easier to share specific startup settings by simply copying a
		file to a directory.
