		Render R Markdown Outputs Lazily // An R Markdown html document
		format that provides the ability to lazily load plot outputs as
		the user scrolls over them.  This is useful for large R
		Markdown documents with many plots, as it allows for a fast
		initial page load and defers loading of individual graphics to
		the time that the user navigates near them.
