		Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs //
		Provides tools to help organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
		The tools provided control the structure and back-end of the
		Monte Carlo simulations by utilizing a generate-analyse-
		summarise strategy. The functions control common simulation
		issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results, support
		parallel back-end computations, save and restore temporary
		files, aggregate results across independent nodes, and provide
		native support for debugging.
