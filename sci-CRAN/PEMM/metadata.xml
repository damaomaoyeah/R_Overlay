		A Penalized EM algorithm incorporating missing-data mechanism //
		This package provides functions to perform multivariate
		Gaussian parameter estimation based on data with abundance-
		dependent missingness. It implements a penalized Expectation-
		Maximization (EM) algorithm. The package is tailored for but
		not limited to proteomics data applications, in which a large
		proportion of the data are often missing-not-at-random with
		lower values (or absolute values) more likely to be missing.
