		Non-Parametric Multiple Change-Point Analysis of Multivariate
		Data // Implements various procedures for finding multiple
		change-points through the use of U-statistics. The procedures
		do not make any distributional assumptions other than the
		existence of certain absolute moments. Hierarchical and exact
		search methods are included. All methods return the set of
		estimated change-points as well as other summary information.
