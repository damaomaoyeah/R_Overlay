		Track Objects (last release - package name changed to 'track') //
		Final release of 'trackObjs' - package name changed to 'track'
		- if using 'trackObjs' please switch to 'track'. Tracking
		database are the same with 'track' and 'trackObjs'.
		Automatically stores objects in files on disk so that files are
		rewritten when objects are changed, and so that objects are
		accessible but do not occupy memory until they are accessed.
		Keeps track of times when objects are created and modified, and
		caches some basic characteristics of objects to allow for fast
		summaries of objects.  Also provides a command history
		mechanism that saves the last command to a history file after
		each command completes.
