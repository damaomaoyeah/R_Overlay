		Classical Simultaneous Equation Models // Likelihood-based
		approaches to estimate linear regression parameters and
		treatment effects in the presence of endogeneity. Specifically,
		this package includes James Heckman's classical simultaneous
		equation models-the sample selection model for outcome
		selection bias and hybrid model with structural shift for
		endogenous treatment. For more information, see the seminal
		paper of Heckman (1978) DOI:10.3386/w0177 in which the details
		of these models are provided. This package accommodates
		repeated measures on subjects with a working independence
		approach. The hybrid model further accommodates treatment
		effect modification.
