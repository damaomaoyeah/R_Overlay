		An Implementation of a SAS-Style Data Step // Based on a SAS data
		step. This allows for row-wise dynamic building of data,
		iteratively importing slices of existing dataframes, conducting
		analyses, and exporting to a results frame. This is
		particularly useful for differential or time-series analyses,
		which are often not well suited to vector- based operations.
