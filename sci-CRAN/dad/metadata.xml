		Three-Way Data Analysis Through Densities // The three-way data
		consists of a set of variables measured on several groups of
		individuals. To each group is associated an estimated
		probability density function. The package provides functional
		methods (principal component analysis, multidimensional
		scaling, discriminant analysis...) for such probability
		densities.
