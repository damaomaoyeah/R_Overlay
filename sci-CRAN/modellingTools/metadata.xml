		A Collection of Useful Custom Tools for DA and Modelling //
		Useful functions for performing common data analysis tasks that
		I could not find in other packages. For example, flexible
		functions for discretizing ("binning") continuous variables are
		included, since this is a common technique used in industry
		that is not well appreciated in academia. See the vignette for
		a more detailed high-level explanation, or the documentation
		for full details.
