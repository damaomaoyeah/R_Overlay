		Decode Coded Variables to Plain Text and the Other Way Around //
		Main function "decode" is used to decode coded key values to
		plain text. Function "code" can be used to code plain text to
		code if there is a 1:1 relation between the two. The concept
		relies on 'keyvalue' objects used for translation. There are
		several 'keyvalue' objects included in the areas of
		geographical regional codes, administrative health care unit
		codes, diagnosis codes and more. It is also easy to extend the
		use by arbitrary code sets.
