		Unicode Symbols at the R Prompt // A small subset of Unicode
		symbols, that are useful when building command line
		applications. They fall back to alternatives on terminals that
		do not support Unicode. Many symbols were taken from the
		'figures' 'npm' package (see
		https://github.com/sindresorhus/figures).
