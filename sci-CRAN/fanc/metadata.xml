		Penalized Likelihood Factor Analysis via Nonconvex Penalty // An
		R package "fanc" computes the penalized maximum likelihood
		estimates of factor loadings and unique variances for various
		tuning parameters. The pathwise coordinate descent along with
		EM algorithm is used.  This package also includes a new
		graphical tool which outputs path diagram, goodness-of-fit
		indices and model selection criteria for each regularization
		parameter. The user can change the regularization parameter by
		manipulating scrollbars, which is helpful to find a suitable
		value of regularization parameter.
