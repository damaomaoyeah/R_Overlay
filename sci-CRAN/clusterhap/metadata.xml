		Clustering Genotypes in Haplotypes // One haplotype is a
		combination of SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) within the
		QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). clusterhap groups together all
		individuals of a population with the same haplotype. Each group
		contains individual with the same allele in each SNP, whether
		or not missing data. Thus, clusterhap groups individuals, that
		to be imputed, have a non-zero probability of having the same
		alleles in the entire sequence of SNP's. Moreover, clusterhap
		calculates such probability from relative frequencies.
