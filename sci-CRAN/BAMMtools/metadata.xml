		Analysis and Visualization of Macroevolutionary Dynamics on
		Phylogenetic Trees // Provides functions for analyzing and
		visualizing complex macroevolutionary dynamics on phylogenetic
		trees. It is a companion package to the command line program
		BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) and is
		entirely oriented towards the analysis, interpretation, and
		visualization of evolutionary rates. Functionality includes
		visualization of rate shifts on phylogenies, estimating
		evolutionary rates through time, comparing posterior
		distributions of evolutionary rates across clades, comparing
		diversification models using Bayes factors, and more.
