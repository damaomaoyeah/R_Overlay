		Bayesian Networks  Path Analysis // We proposed a hybrid approach
		using the computational and statistical  resources of the
		Bayesian Networks to learn a network structure from a data set
		using 4 different algorithms and the robustness of the
		statistical methods present in the Structural Equation Modeling
		to check the goodness of fit from model over data. We built an
		intermediate algorithm to join the features of 'bnlearn' and
		'lavaan' R packages. The Bayesian Networks structure learning
		algorithms used were 'Hill-Climbing', 'Max-Min Hill-Climbing',
		'Restricted Maximization' and 'Tabu Search'.
