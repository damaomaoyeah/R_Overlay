		Multiple Hypotheses Testing for Discrete Data // A Comprehensive
		tool for almost all existing multiple testing methods for
		discrete data. The package also provides some novel multiple
		testing procedures controlling FWER/FDR for discrete data. In
		order to make decisions conveniently,  given discrete p-values
		and their domains, the [method].p.adjust function returns
		adjusted p-values, which can be used to compare with the
		nominal significant level alpha.
