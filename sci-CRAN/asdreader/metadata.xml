		Reading ASD Binary Files in R // A simple driver that reads
		binary data created by the ASD Inc. portable spectrometer
		instruments, such as the FieldSpec (for more information, see
		http://www.asdi.com/products/fieldspec-spectroradiometers).
		Spectral data can be extracted from the ASD files as raw (DN),
		white reference, radiance, or reflectance. Additionally, the
		metadata information contained in the ASD file header can also
		be accessed.
