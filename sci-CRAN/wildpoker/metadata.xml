		Best Hand Analysis for Poker Variants Including Wildcards //
		Provides insight into how the best hand for a poker game
		changes based on the game dealt, players who stay in until the
		showdown and wildcards added to the base game.  At this time
		the package does not support player tactics, so draw poker
		variants are not included.
