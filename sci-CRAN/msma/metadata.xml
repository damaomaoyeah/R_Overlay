		Multiblock Sparse Multivariable Analysis // There are several
		functions to implement the method for analysis in a multiblock
		multivariable data. If the input is only a matrix, then the
		principal components analysis (PCA) is implemented. If the
		input is a list of matrices, then the multiblock PCA is
		implemented. If the input is two matrices for exploratory and
		objective variables, then the partial least squares (PLS)
		analysis is implemented. If the input is two list of matrices
		for exploratory and objective variables, then the multiblock
		PLS analysis is implemented. Moreover, if the extra outcome
		variable is specified, then the supervised version for the
		methods above is implemented. For each methods, the sparse
		modeling is also incorporated. Functions to select the number
		of components and the regularized parameters are also provided.
