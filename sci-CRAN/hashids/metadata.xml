		Generate Short Unique YouTube-Like IDs (Hashes) from Integers //
		An R port of the hashids library.  hashids generates YouTube-
		like hashes from integers or vector of integers.  Hashes
		generated from integers are relatively short, unique and non-
		seqential.  hashids can be used to generate unique ids for URLs
		and hide database row numbers from the user.  By default
		hashids will avoid generating common English cursewords by
		preventing certain letters being next to each other.  hashids
		are not one-way: it is easy to encode an integer to a hashid
		and decode a hashid back into an integer.
