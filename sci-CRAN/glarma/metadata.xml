		Generalized Linear Autoregressive Moving Average Models // This
		package provides functions for estimation, testing, diagnostic
		checking and forecasting of generalized linear autoregressive
		moving average (GLARMA) models for discrete valued time series
		with regression variables.  These are a class of observation
		driven non-linear non-Gaussian state space models. The state
		vector consists of a linear regression component plus an
		observation driven component consisting of an autoregressive-
		moving average (ARMA) filter of past predictive residuals.
		Currently three distributions (Poisson, negative binomial and
		binomial) can be used for the response series. Three options
		(Pearson, score-type and unscaled) for the residuals in the
		observation driven component are available. Estimation is via
		maximum likelihood (conditional on initializing values for the
		ARMA process) optimized using Fisher scoring or Newton Raphson
		iterative methods. Likelihood ratio and Wald tests for the
		observation driven component allow testing for serial
		dependence in generalized linear model settings. Graphical
		diagnostics including model fits, autocorrelation functions and
		probability integral transform residuals are included in the
		package. Several standard data sets are included in the
		package.
