		Multivariate Random Forest for Linearly Related Output Features
		// In Random Forest, prediction has been done for single output
		feature, while linear relation between the output features has
		not been considered in other packages. In this package, using
		linear relation of the output features, a multivariate random
		forest prediction has been done, which can predict all the
		output features with one Random forest. If there is high
		correlation among the features, this MRF prediction gives
		better result than the individual RFs.
