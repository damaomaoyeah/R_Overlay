		Optimal Mixture Weights in Multiple Importance Sampling // Code
		for optimal mixture weights in importance sampling. Workhorse
		functions penoptpersp() and penoptpersp.alpha.only() minimize
		estimated variances with and without control variates
		respectively. It can be used in adaptive mixture importance
		sampling, for example, function batch.estimation() does two
		stages, a pilot estimate of mixing alpha and a following
		importance sampling.
