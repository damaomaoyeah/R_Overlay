		Hierarchical DECOmposition of Entropy for Categorical Map
		Comparisons // A flexible and hierarchical framework for
		comparing categorical map composition and configuration
		(spatial pattern) along spatial, thematic, or external grouping
		variables.  Comparisons are based on measures of mutual
		information between thematic classes (colours) and location
		(spatial partitioning).  Results are returned in textual,
		tabular, and graphical forms.
