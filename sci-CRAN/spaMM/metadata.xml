		Mixed Models, Particularly Spatial GLMMs // Inference in mixed
		models, including GLMMs with spatial correlations and models
		with non-Gaussian random effects (e.g., Beta Binomial, or
		negative-binomial mixed models). Heteroscedasticity can further
		be fitted by a linear model. The algorithms are currently
		various Laplace approximations methods for ML or REML, in
		particular h-likelihood and penalized-likelihood methods.
