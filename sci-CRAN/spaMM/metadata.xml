		Mixed Models, Particularly Spatial GLMMs // Implements a
		collection of functions for inference in mixed models. It was
		developed in particular for GLMMs with spatial correlations,
		but also fits models with non-Gaussian random effects (e.g.,
		Beta Binomial, or negative-binomial mixed models).
		Heteroskedasticity can further be fitted by a linear model. The
		algorithms are currently various Laplace approximations methods
		for ML or REML, in particular h-likelihood and penalized-
		likelihood methods.
