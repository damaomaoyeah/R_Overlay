		Distributions, Statistics and Tests derived from Random Matrix
		Theory // Functions for working with the Tracy-Widom laws and
		other distributions related to the eigenvalues of large Wishart
		matrices. The tables for computing the Tracy-Widom densities
		and distribution functions were computed by Momar Dieng's
		MATLAB package "RMLab" (formerly available on his homepage at
		http://math.arizona.edu/~momar/research.htm ). This package is
		part of a collaboration between Iain Johnstone, Zongming Ma,
		Patrick Perry, and Morteza Shahram.  It will soon be replaced
		by a package with more accuracy and built-in support for
		relevant statistical tests.
