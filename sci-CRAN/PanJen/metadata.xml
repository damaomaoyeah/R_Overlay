		A Semi-Parametric Test for Specifying Functional Form // A
		central decision in a parametric regression is how to specify
		the relation between an dependent variable and each explanatory
		variable. This package provides a semi-parametric tool for
		comparing different transformations of an  explanatory
		variables in a parametric regression. The functions is relevant
		in a situation, where you would use a box-cox or Box-Tidwell
		transformations.  In contrast to the classic power-
		transformations, the methods in this package allows for
		theoretical driven user input and the possibility to compare
		with a non-parametric transformation.
