		Trend Classification Algorithm // This algorithm classifies the
		trends into linear, quadratic, cubic, concealed and no-trend
		types. The "concealed trends" are those trends that possess
		quadratic or cubic forms, but the net change from the start of
		the time period to the end of the time period hasn't been
		significant. The "no-trend" category includes simple linear
		trends with statistically in-significant slope coefficient.
