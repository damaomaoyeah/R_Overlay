		Trend Classification Algorithm // This algorithm can classify the
		trends as linear, quadratic, cubic, concealed or no-trend. The
		"concealed trend" are those trends that possess quadratic or
		cubic forms, but the net change between the start and end of
		the period hasn't been significant. While, the "no-trend"
		category includes simple linear trends that are below the
		significant slope coefficient.
