		Maximum penalized likelihood estimation with extended lasso
		penalty // The package estimates coefficients of extended LASSO
		penalized linear regression and generalized linear models.
		Currently lasso and elastic net penalized linear regression and
		generalized linear models are considered. The package currently
		utilizes an accurate approximation of L1 penalty and then a
		modified Jacobi algorithm to estimate the coefficients. There
		is provision for plotting of the solutions and predictions of
		coefficients at given values of lambda. The package also
		contains functions for cross validation to select a suitable
		lambda value given the data. The package also provides a
		function for estimation in fused lasso penalized linear
		regression.
