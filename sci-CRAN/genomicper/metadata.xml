		Circular Genomic Permutation using GWAS p-values of association
		// Circular genomic permutation approach uses GWAS results to
		establish the significance of pathway/gene-set associations
		whilst accounting for genomic structure. All SNPs in the GWAS
		are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location.
		Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted
		by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations
