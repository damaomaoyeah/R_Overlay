		Circular Genomic Permutation using Gwas p-Values of Association
		// Circular genomic permutation approach uses GWAS results to
		establish the significance of pathway/gene-set associations
		whilst accounting for genomic structure. All SNPs in the GWAS
		are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location.
		Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted
		by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations. Two
		testing frameworks are available: permutations at the gene
		level, and permutations at the SNP level. The permutation at
		the gene level uses fisher's combination test to calculate a
		single gene p-value, followed by the hypergeometric test. The
		SNP count methodology maps each SNP to pathways/gene-sets and
		calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real and the
		permutated datasets above a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper
		requires a matrix of GWAS association p-values. The SNPs
		annotation and pathways annotations can be performed within the
		package or provided by the user.
