		Computational Routines for Proton and Ion Radiotherapy // R
		interface to the open-source, ANSI C library 'libamtrack'
		(http://libamtrack.dkfz.org). 'libamtrack' provides
		computational routines for the prediction of detector response
		and radiobiological efficiency in heavy charged particle beams.
		It is designed for research in proton and ion dosimetry and
		radiotherapy. 'libamtrack' also includes many auxiliary physics
		routines for proton and ion beams. Original package and C-to-R
		conversion routines developed by Felix A. Klein.
