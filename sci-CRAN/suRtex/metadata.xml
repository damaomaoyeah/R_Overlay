		LaTeX descriptive statistic reporting for survey data // suRtex
		was designed for easy descriptive statistic reporting of
		categorical survey data (e.g., Likert scales) in LaTeX. suRtex
		takes a matrix or data frame and produces the LaTeX code
		necessary for a sideways table creation. Mean, median, standard
		deviation, and sample size are optional.
