		Isoscape Computation and Inference of Spatial Origins using Mixed
		Models // Building isoscapes using mixed models and inferring
		the geographic origin of organisms based on their isotopic
		ratios. This package is essentially a simplified interface to
		several other packages. It uses 'spaMM' for fitting and
		predicting isoscapes, and assigning an organism's origin
		depending on its isotopic ratio. 'IsoriX' also relies heavily
		on the package 'rasterVis' for plotting the maps using lattice.
