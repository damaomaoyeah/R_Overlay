		Distribution Pitting // Compares distributions with one another
		in terms of their fit to each sample in a dataset that contains
		multiple samples, as described in Joo, Aguinis, and Bradley (in
		press). Users can examine the fit of seven distributions per
		sample: pure power law, lognormal, exponential, power law with
		an exponential cutoff, normal, Poisson, and Weibull. Automation
		features allow the user to compare all distributions for all
		samples with a single command line, which creates a separate
		row containing results for each sample until the entire dataset
		has been analyzed.
