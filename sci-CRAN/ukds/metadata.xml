		Reproducible Data Retrieval from the UK Data Service //
		Reproducible, programmatic retrieval of datasets from the UK
		Data Service https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk. The UKDS is "the
		UK's largest collection of social, economic and population data
		resources," but researchers taking advantage of these datasets
		are caught in a bind. The UKDS terms and conditions sharply
		limit redistribution of downloaded datasets, but to ensure that
		one's work can be reproduced, assessed, and built upon by
		others, one must provide access to the raw data one employed.
		The ukds package cuts this knot by providing programmatic,
		reproducible access to the UKDS datasets from within R.
