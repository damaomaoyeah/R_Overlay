		Klimontovich's S-Theorem Algorithm Implementation and Data
		Preparation Tools // Functions implementing the procedure of
		entropy comparison between two data samples after the
		renormalization of respective probability distributions with
		the algorithm designed by Klimontovich (Zeitschrift fur Physik
		B Condensed Matter. 1987, Volume 66, Issue 1, pp 125-127) and
		extended by Anishchenko (Proc. SPIE 2098, Computer Simulation
		in Nonlinear Optics. 1994, pp.130-136).  The package also
		includes data preparation tools which can also be used
		separately for various applications.
