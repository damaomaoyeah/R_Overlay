		insideRODE package includes buildin functions from deSolve,
		compiled functions from compiler, and C/FORTRAN code interfaces
		to nlme. It includes nlmLSODA, nlmODE, nlmVODE,nlmLSODE for
		general purpose; cfLSODA,cfLSODE, cfODE, cfVODE call C/FORTRAN
		compiled dll functions.ver2.0 add sink()function into example
		it helps to directly combine c/fortran source code in R files.
		Finally, with new compiler package, we generated compiled
		functions: nlmODEcp, nlmVODEcp, nlmLSODEcp,nlmLSODAcp and
		cpODE, cpLSODA, cpLSODE, cpVODE. They will help to increase
		speed.
