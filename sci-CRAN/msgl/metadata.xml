		High Dimensional Multiclass Classification Using Sparse Group
		Lasso // Multinomial logistic regression with sparse group
		lasso penalty. Simultaneous feature selection and parameter
		estimation for classification. Suitable for high dimensional
		multiclass classification with many classes. The algorithm
		computes the sparse group lasso penalized maximum likelihood
		estimate. Use of multiple processors for cross validation and
		subsampling is supported through OpenMP. Development version is
		on github, please report package issues on github.
