		Tools for Discrete Multivariate Mixed Membership Models // Fits
		mixed membership models with discrete multivariate data (with
		or without repeated measures) following the general framework
		of Erosheva 2004. This package uses a Variational EM approach
		by approximating the posterior distribution of latent
		memberships and selecting hyperparameters through a pseudo-MLE
		procedure. Currently supported data types are Bernoulli,
		multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce).
