		Software Option Settings Manager for R // Provides option
		settings management that goes beyond R's default 'options'
		function. With this package, users can define their own option
		settings manager holding option names and default values.
		Settings can then be retrieved, altered and reset to defaults
		with ease. For R programmers and package developers it offers
		cloning and merging functionality which allows for conveniently
		defining global and local options, possibly in a multilevel
		options hierarchy. See the package vignette for some examples
		concerning functions, S4 classes, and reference classes. There
		are convenience functions to reset par() and options() to their
		'factory defaults'.
