		Pricing of Variable Annuities // Pricing of variable annuity life
		insurance contracts by means of Monte Carlo methods. Monte
		Carlo is used to price the contract in case the policyholder
		cannot surrender while Least Squares Monte Carlo is used if the
		insured can surrender. A state-dependent fee structure with a
		single barrier is implemented.
