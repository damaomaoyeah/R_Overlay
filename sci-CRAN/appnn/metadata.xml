		Amyloid Propensity Prediction Neural Network // Amyloid
		propensity prediction neural network (APPNN) is an
		amyloidogenicity propensity predictor based on a machine
		learning approach through recursive feature selection and feed-
		forward neural networks, taking advantage of newly published
		sequences with experimental, in vitro, evidence of amyloid
		formation.
