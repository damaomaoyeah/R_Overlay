		Estimating IRT Parameters using the IRT Methodology // An
		implementation of the IRT paradigm for the scoring of different
		instruments measuring latent traits (a.k.a Abilities) and
		estimating item parameters for a variety of models, this
		package is highly optimized using Rcpp and carefully written R
		for the rest of the package, it aims to expand IRT applications
		to those applications that require faster and more robust
		estimation procedures. See the IRTpp documentation and github
		site for more information and examples.
