		A fast, unbiased and exact allelic exact test // This is the
		implementation in R+C of a new association test described in "A
		fast, unbiased and exact allelic exact test for case-control
		association studies" (Submitted).  It appears that in most
		cases the classical chi-square test used for testing for
		allelic association on genotype data is biased. Our test is
		unbiased, exact but fast throught careful optimization.
