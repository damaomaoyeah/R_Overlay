		Multivariate Dependence with Copulas // Classes (S4) of commonly
		used elliptical, Archimedean, extreme value and some more
		copula families.  Methods for density, distribution, random
		number generation, bivariate dependence measures, perspective
		and contour plots.  Fitting copula models including variance
		estimates. Independence and serial (univariate and
		multivariate) independence tests, and other copula related
		tests. Empirical copula and multivariate CDF. Goodness-of-fit
		tests for copulas based on multipliers, the parametric
		bootstrap with several transformation options. Merged former
		package 'nacopula' for nested Archimedean copulas: Efficient
		sampling algorithms, various estimators, goodness-of-fit tests
		and related tools and special functions.
