		Nonparametric Analysis of Bivariate Gap Time with Competing Risks
		// For studying recurrent disease and death with competing
		risks, comparisons based on the well-known cumulative incidence
		function can be confounded by different prevalence rates of the
		competing events. Alternatively, comparisons of the conditional
		distribution of the survival time given the failure event type
		are more relevant for investigating the prognosis of different
		patterns of recurrence disease. This package implements a
		nonparametric estimator for the conditional cumulative
		incidence function and a nonparametric conditional bivariate
		cumulative incidence function for the bivariate gap times
		proposed in Huang et al. (2016) doi:10.1111/biom.12494.
