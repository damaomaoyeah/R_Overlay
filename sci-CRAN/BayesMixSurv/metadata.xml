		Bayesian Mixture Survival Models using Additive Mixture-of-
		Weibull Hazards, with Lasso Shrinkage and Stratification //
		Bayesian Mixture Survival Models using Additive Mixture-of-
		Weibull Hazards, with Lasso Shrinkage and Stratification. As a
		Bayesian dynamic survival model, it relaxes the proportional-
		hazard assumption. Lasso shrinkage controls overfitting, given
		the increase in the number of free parameters in the model due
		to presence of two Weibull components in the hazard function.
