		Distance Weighted Discrimination (DWD) and Kernel Methods // A
		novel implementation that solves the DWD and the kernel DWD
		which can be hundred times faster than the existing
		implementation of DWD based on the second-order-cone
		programming (SOCP). The package also handles some other general
		loss functions including large-margin unified machines (LUM).
