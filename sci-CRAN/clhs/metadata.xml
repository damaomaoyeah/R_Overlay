		Conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling // This package implements
		the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling, as published by
		Minasny and McBratney (2006). This method proposes to stratify
		sampling in presence of ancillary data. An extension of this
		method, which propose to associate a cost to each individual
		and take it into account during the optimisation process, is
		also proposed (Roudier et al., 2012).
