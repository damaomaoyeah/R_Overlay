		Nonparametric kernel estimation of the distribution function.
		Bandwidth selection and estimation of related functions. //
		Nonparametric kernel distribution function estimation is
		performed. Three automatic bandwidth selection methods for
		nonparametric kernel distribution function estimation are
		implemented: the plug-in of Altman and Leger, the plug-in of
		Polansky and Baker, and the modified cross-validation of
		Bowman, Hall and Prvan. The exceedance function, the mean
		return period and the return level are also computed.
