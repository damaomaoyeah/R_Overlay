		Comparing Restricted Mean Survival Time // Performs two-sample
		comparisons using the restricted mean survival time (RMST) as a
		summary measure of the survival time distribution. Three kinds
		of between-group contrast metrics (i.e., the difference in
		RMST, the ratio of RMST and the ratio of the restricted mean
		time lost (RMTL)) are computed. It performs an ANCOVA-type
		covariate adjustment as well as unadjusted analyses for those
		measures.
