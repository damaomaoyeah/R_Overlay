		Feature Extraction for Discretely-Sampled Functional Data //
		Discretely-sampled function is first smoothed.  Features of the
		smoothed function are then extracted.  Some of the key features
		include mean value, first and second derivatives, critical
		points (i.e. local maxima and minima), curvature of cunction at
		critical points, wiggliness of the function, noise in data, and
		outliers in data.
