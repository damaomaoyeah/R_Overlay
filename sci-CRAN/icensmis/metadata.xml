		Study Design and Data Analysis in the Presence of Error-Prone
		Diagnostic Tests and Self-Reported Outcomes // We consider
		studies in which information from error-prone diagnostic tests
		or self-reports are gathered sequentially to determine the
		occurrence of a silent event. Using a likelihood-based approach
		incorporating the proportional hazards assumption, we provide
		functions to estimate the survival distribution and covariate
		effects. We also provide functions for power and sample size
		calculations for this setting.
