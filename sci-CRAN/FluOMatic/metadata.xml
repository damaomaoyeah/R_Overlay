		Estimation of background-subtracted fluorescence data // Simulate
		and analyse fluorescence data sets obtained from calcium
		imaging experiments in living cells (such as neurons). The
		package provide tools to estimate background-subtracted
		fluorescence transients and build meaningful confidence
		intervals on these estimations. This covers both the case of
		homogeneous background fluorescence and that of Regions Of
		Interest (ROI) displaying background inhomogeneities.
		Background-subtracted fluorescence transients can be fitted
		with monoexponential models or estimated pointwise.
