		Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data // Extend lasso and
		elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-dimensional, multi-
		gigabyte data sets that cannot be loaded into memory. It's much
		more memory- and computation-efficient as compared to existing
		lasso-fitting packages like 'glmnet' and 'ncvreg', thus
		allowing for very powerful big data analysis even with an
		ordinary laptop.
