		Big Lasso: Extending Lasso Model Fitting to Big Data in R //
		Extend lasso and elastic-net model fitting for ultrahigh-
		dimensional, multi-gigabyte data sets that cannot be loaded
		into memory. Compared to existing lasso-fitting packages, it
		preserves equivalently fast computation speed but is much more
		memory-efficient, thus allowing for very powerful big data
		analysis even with only a single laptop.
