		Benchmarking routine for R // rbenchmark is inspired by the Perl
		module Benchmark, and is intended to facilitate benchmarking of
		arbitrary R code. The library consists of just one function,
		benchmark, which is a simple wrapper around system.time.  Given
		a specification of the benchmarking process (counts of
		replications, evaluation environment) and an arbitrary number
		of expressions, benchmark evaluates each of the expressions in
		the specified environment, replicating the evaluation as many
		times as specified, and returning the results conveniently
		wrapped into a data frame.
