		Estimation of Conditional Quantiles using Optimal Quantization //
		Estimation of conditional quantiles using optimal quantization.
		Construction of an optimal grid of N quantizers, estimation of
		conditional quantiles and data driven selection of the size N
		of the grid. Graphical illustrations for the selection of N and
		of resulting estimated curves or surfaces when the dimension of
		the covariate is one or two.
