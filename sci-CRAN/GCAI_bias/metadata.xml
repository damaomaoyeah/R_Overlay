		Guided Correction Approach for Inherited bias (GCAI.bias) // Many
		inherited biases and effects exists in RNA-seq due to both
		biological and technical effects. We observed the biological
		variance of testing target transcripts can influence the yield
		of sequencing reads, which might indicate a resource
		competition existing in RNA-seq. We developed this package to
		capture the bias depending on local sequence and perform the
		correction of this type of bias by borrowing information from
		spike-in measurement.
