		Individual Conditional Expectation Plot Toolbox // Implements
		Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for
		visualizing the model estimated by any supervised learning
		algorithm. ICE plots refine Friedman's partial dependence plot
		by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted
		response and a covariate of interest for individual
		observations. Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation
		in the fitted values across the range of a covariate of
		interest, suggesting where and to what extent they may exist.
