		Efficient multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs // mkssd
		is a package that generates efficient balanced non-aliased
		multi-level k-circulant supersaturated designs by interchanging
		the elements of the generator vector. The package tries to
		generate a supersaturated design that has chisquare efficiency
		more than user specified efficiency level (mef). The package
		also displays the progress of generation of an efficient multi-
		level k-circulant design through a progress bar. The progress
		of 100% means that one full round of interchange is completed.
		More than one full round (typically 4-5 rounds) of interchange
		may be required for larger designs.
