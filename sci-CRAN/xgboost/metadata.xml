		eXtreme Gradient Boosting // This package is a R wrapper of
		xgboost, which is short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting. It is an
		efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting
		framework. The package includes efficient linear model solver
		and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically do
		parallel computation with OpenMP, and it can be more than 10
		times faster than existing gradient boosting packages such as
		gbm. It supports various objective functions, including
		regression, classification and ranking. The package is made to
		be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define their
		own objectives easily.
