		An Implementation of the Typicality and Eccentricity Data
		Analysis Framework // The typicality and eccentricity data
		analysis (TEDA) framework was put forward by Angelov (2013)
		DOI:10.14313/JAMRIS_2-2014/16. It has been further developed
		into multiple different techniques since, and provides a non-
		parametric way of determining how similar an observation, from
		a process that is not purely random, is to other observations
		generated by the process. This package provides code to use the
		batch and recursive TEDA methods that have been published.
