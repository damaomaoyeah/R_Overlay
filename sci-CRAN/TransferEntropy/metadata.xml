		The Transfer Entropy Package // Estimates the transfer entropy
		from one time series to another, where each time series
		consists of continuous random variables. The transfer entropy
		is an extension of mutual information which takes into account
		the direction of information flow, under the assumption that
		the underlying processes can be described by a Markov model.
		Two estimation methods are provided. The first calculates
		transfer entropy as the difference of mutual information.
		Mutual information is estimated using the Kraskov method, which
		builds on a nearest-neighbor framework (see package
		references). The second estimation method estimate transfer
		entropy via the a generalized correlation sum.
