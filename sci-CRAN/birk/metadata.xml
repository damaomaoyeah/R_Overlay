		MA Birk's Functions // This is a compilation of functions that I
		found useful to make. It currently includes a unit of
		measurement conversion function, a Q10 calculator for
		temperature dependence of chemical and biological rates, and
		some miscellaneous wrapper functions to make R code shorter and
		faster to write.
