		Calculating Proportionality Between Vectors of Compositional Data
		// The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often
		begins with correlation-based analyses. However, this approach
		lacks statistical validity when applied to relative data,
		including those biological count data produced by microarray
		assays or high-throughput RNA-sequencing. Two metrics of
		proportionality, phi [Lovell et al (2015)
		DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075] and rho [Erb and Notredame
		(2016) DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8], both derived from
		compositional data analysis, a branch of math dealing
		specifically with relative data, represent novel alternatives
		to correlation. This package introduces a programmatic
		framework for the calculation of feature dependence through
		proportionality, as discussed in the cited publications.
