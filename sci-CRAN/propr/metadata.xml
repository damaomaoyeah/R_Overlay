		Calculating Proportionality Between Vectors of Compositional Data
		// The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often
		begins with correlation-based analyses. However, this approach
		lacks statistical validity when applied to relative data,
		including those biological count data produced by microarray
		assays or high-throughput RNA-sequencing. As an alternative,
		Lovell et al propose a proportionality metric, phi, derived
		from compositional data analysis, a branch of math dealing
		specifically with relative data. In a subsequent publication,
		Erb and Nicodemus expounded these efforts by elaborating on
		another proportionality metric, rho. This package introduces a
		programmatic framework for the calculation of feature
		dependence through proportionality, as discussed in the cited
		publications.
