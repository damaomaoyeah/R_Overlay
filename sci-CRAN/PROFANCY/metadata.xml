		The package can prioritize candidate disease metabolites based on
		global functional relationships between metabolites in the
		context of metabolic pathways // The package can prioritize the
		candidate disease metabolites based on the assumption that
		functionally related metabolites tend to associate with the
		same or similar diseases in the context of metabolic pathway.
		The PROFANCY package (1) prioritizes the disease metabolites
		from global functional similarity and local modularity of the
		metabolic network; (2) allows users to select default
		metabolites or input their interested metabolites as seed nodes
		or candidate nodes (3) can prioritize the candidate metabolites
		in KEGG or EHMN metabolic network.
