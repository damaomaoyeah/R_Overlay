		Public Subject Attention via Wikipedia Page Access Statistics //
		Public attention is an interesting field of study. The internet
		not only allows to access information in no time on virtually
		any subject but via page access statistics gathered by website
		authors the subject of attention as well can be studied. For
		the omnipresent Wikipedia those access statistics are made
		available via 'http://stats.grok.se' a server providing the
		information as file dumps as well as as web API. This package
		provides an easy to use, consistent and traffic minimizing
		approach to make those data accessible within R.
