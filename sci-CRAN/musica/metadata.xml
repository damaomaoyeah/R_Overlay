		Multiscale Climate Model Assessment // Provides functions
		allowing for (1) easy aggregation of multivariate time series
		into custom time scales, (2) comparison of statistical
		summaries between different data sets at multiple time scales
		(e.g. observed and bias-corrected data), (3) comparison of
		relations between variables and/or different data sets at
		multiple time scales (e.g. correlation of precipitation and
		temperature in control and scenario simulation) and (4)
		transformation of time series at custom time scales.
