		Fuzzy Forests // Fuzzy forests, a new algorithm based on random
		forests, is designed to reduce the bias seen in random forest
		feature selection caused by the presence of correlated
		features.  Fuzzy forests uses recursive feature elimination
		random forests to select features from separate blocks of
		correlated features where the correlation within each block of
		features is high and the correlation between blocks of features
		is low. One final random forest is fit using the surviving
		features. This package fits random forests using the
		'randomForest' package and allows for easy use of 'WGCNA' to
		split features into distinct blocks.
