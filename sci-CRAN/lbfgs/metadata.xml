		Limited-memory BFGS Optimization // A wrapper built around the
		libLBFGS optimization library by Naoaki Okazaki. The lbfgs
		package implements both the Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-
		Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) and the Orthant-Wise Quasi-Newton
		Limited-Memory (OWL-QN) optimization algorithms. The L-BFGS
		algorithm solves the problem of minimizing an objective, given
		its gradient, by iteratively computing approximations of the
		inverse Hessian matrix. The OWL-QN algorithm finds the optimum
		of an objective plus the L1-norm of the problem's parameters.
		The package offers a fast and memory-efficient implementation
		of these optimization routines, which is particularly suited
		for high-dimensional problems.
