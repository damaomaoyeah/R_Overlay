		Causal Mediation Analysis Using Weighting Approach // We
		implement causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed
		by Hong (2010) and Hong, Deutsch  Hill (2015)
		doi:10.3102/1076998615583902. It allows the estimation and
		hypothesis testing of causal mediation effects through ratio of
		mediator probability weights (RMPW). This strategy conveniently
		relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction
		while greatly simplifying the outcome model specification
		without invoking strong distributional assumptions.
