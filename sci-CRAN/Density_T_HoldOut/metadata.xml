		Density.T.HoldOut: Non-combinatorial T-estimation Hold-Out for
		density estimation // Implementation in the density framework
		of the non-combinatorial algorithm and its greedy version,
		introduced by Magalhes and Rozenholc (2014), for T-estimation
		Hold-Out proposed in Birg (2006, Section 9). The package
		provide an implementation which uses several families of
		estimators (regular and irregular histograms, kernel
		estimators) which may be used alone or combined. As a
		complement, provides also a comparison with other Held-Out
		derived from least-squares and maximum-likelihood. This package
		implements also the T-estimation Hold-Out derived from the test
		introduced in Baraud (2011).
