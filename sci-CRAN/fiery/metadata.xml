		A Lightweight and Flexible Web Framework // A very flexible
		framework for building server side logic in R. The framework is
		unoppinionated when it comes to how HTTP requests and WebSocket
		messages are handled and supports all levels of app complexity;
		from serving static content to full-blown dynamic web-apps.
		Fiery does not hold your hand as much as e.g. the shiny package
		does, but instead sets you free to create your web app the way
		you want.
