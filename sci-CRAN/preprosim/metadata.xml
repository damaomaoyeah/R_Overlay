		Lightweight Data Quality Simulation for Classification // Data
		quality simulation can be used to check the robustness of data
		analysis findings and learn about the impact of data quality
		contaminations on classification. This package helps to add
		contaminations (noise, missing values, outliers, low variance,
		irrelevant features, class swap (inconsistency), class
		imbalance and decrease in data volume) to data and then
		evaluate the simulated data sets for classification accuracy.
		As a lightweight solution simulation runs can be set up with no
		or minimal up-front effort.
