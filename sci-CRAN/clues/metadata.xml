		Clustering Method Based on Local Shrinking // We developed the
		clues R package to provide functions for automatically
		estimating the number of clusters and getting the final cluster
		partition without any input parameter except the stopping rule
		for convergence. The package also provides functions to
		evaluate and compare the performances of partitions of a data
		set both numerically and graphically.
