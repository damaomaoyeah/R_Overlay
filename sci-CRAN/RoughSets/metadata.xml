		Data Analysis Using Rough Set and Fuzzy Rough Set Theories //
		Implementations of algorithms for data analysis based on the
		rough set theory (RST) and the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST).
		We not only provide implementations for the basic concepts of
		RST and FRST but also popular algorithms that derive from those
		theories. The methods included in the package can be divided
		into several categories based on their functionality:
		discretization, feature selection, instance selection, rule
		induction and classification based on nearest neighbors. RST
		was introduced by Zdzisaw Pawlak in 1982 as a sophisticated
		mathematical tool based on indiscernibility relations to model
		and process imprecise or incomplete information. It works on
		symbolic-valued datasets for tackling the data analysis
		problems. By using the indiscernibility relation for
		objects/instances, RST does not require additional parameters
		to analyze the data. FRST is an extension of RST. The FRST
		combines concepts of vagueness and indiscernibility that are
		expressed with fuzzy sets (as proposed by Zadeh, in 1965) and
		RST.
