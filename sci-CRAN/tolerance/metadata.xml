		Statistical Tolerance Intervals and Regions // Statistical
		tolerance limits provide the limits between which we can expect
		to find a specified proportion of a sampled population with a
		given level of confidence.  This package provides functions for
		estimating tolerance limits (intervals) for various univariate
		distributions (binomial, Cauchy, discrete Pareto, exponential,
		two-parameter exponential, extreme value, hypergeometric,
		Laplace, logistic, negative binomial, negative hypergeometric,
		normal, Pareto, Poisson-Lindley, Poisson, uniform, and Zipf-
		Mandelbrot), Bayesian normal tolerance limits, multivariate
		normal tolerance regions, nonparametric tolerance intervals,
		tolerance bands for regression settings (linear regression,
		nonlinear regression, nonparametric regression, and
		multivariate regression), and analysis of variance tolerance
		intervals.  Visualizations are also available for most of these
		settings.
