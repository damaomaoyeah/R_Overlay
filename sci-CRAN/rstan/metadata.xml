		R Interface to Stan // User-facing R functions are provided by
		this package to parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze
		Stan models by accessing the header-only Stan library provided
		by the 'StanHeaders' package. The Stan project develops a
		probabilistic programming language that implements full
		Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo and
		(optionally penalized) maximum likelihood estimation via
		optimization. In both cases, automatic differentiation is used
		to quickly and accurately evaluate gradients without burdening
		the user with the need to derive the partial derivatives.
