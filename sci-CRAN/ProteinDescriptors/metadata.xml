		Generates Various Protein Descriptors for Machine Learning
		Algorithms // An implementation of protein descriptors in R.
		These descriptors combine the advantages of being fixed length
		and including partial sequential effect: Various length of
		protein sequences are described with fixed length vectors that
		are suitable for machine learning algorithms, and still
		includes partial sequential effect.
