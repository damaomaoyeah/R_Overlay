		Model species distributions by estimating the probability of
		occurrence using presence-only data. // Provides a likelihood-
		based approach to modeling species distributions using
		presence-only data. In contrast to the popular software program
		MAXENT, this approach yields estimates of the probability of
		occurrence, which is a natural descriptor of a species'
		distribution.
