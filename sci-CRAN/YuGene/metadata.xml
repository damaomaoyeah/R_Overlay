		A Simple Approach to Scale Gene Expression Data Derived from
		Different Platforms for Integrated Analyses // Simple method
		for comparison of gene expression generated across different
		experiments, and on different platforms; that does not require
		global renormalization, and is not restricted to comparison of
		identical probes. YuGene works on a range of microarray dataset
		distributions, such as between manufacturers. The resulting
		output allows direct comparisons of gene expression between
		experiments and experimental platforms.
