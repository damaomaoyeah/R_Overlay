		YuGene: A simple approach to scale gene expression data derived
		from different platforms for integrated analyses // YuGene is a
		simple method for comparison of gene expression generated
		across different experiments, and on different platforms; that
		does not require global renormalization, and is not restricted
		to comparison of identical probes. YuGene works on a range of
		microarray dataset distributions, such as between
		manufacturers. The resulting output allows direct comparisons
		of gene expression between experiments and experimental
		platforms.
