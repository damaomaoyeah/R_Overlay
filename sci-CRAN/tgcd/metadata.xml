		Thermoluminescence Glow Curve Deconvolution // Deconvolving
		first-order thermoluminescence glow curves using a modified
		Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. It provides the possibility of
		setting constraints or fixing any of parameters. User-provided
		initially-guessed values can be used for model initialization.
		It also offers an interactive way to initialize parameters by
		clicking with a mouse on a plot at positions where peak maxima
		should be located. The optimal estimate is obtained by "try-
		and-error".
