		Thermoluminescence Glow Curve Deconvolution // Deconvolving
		thermoluminescence glow curves according to the general-order
		empirical expression or the semi-analytical expression derived
		from the one trap- one recombination (OTOR) model based on the
		Lambert's W function using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt
		algorithm. It provides the possibility of setting constraints
		or fixing any of parameters. It offers an interactive way to
		initialize parameters by clicking with a mouse on a plot at
		positions where peak maxima should be located. The optimal
		estimate is obtained by "trial-and-error". It also provides
		routines for simulating first-order, second-order, and general-
		order glow peaks (curves).
