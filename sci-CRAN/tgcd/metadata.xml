		Thermoluminescence Glow Curve Deconvolution // Deconvolving
		first-order and general-order thermoluminescence glow curves
		using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. It provides the
		possibility of setting constraints or fixing any of parameters.
		It offers an interactive way to initialize parameters by
		clicking with a mouse on a plot at positions where peak maxima
		should be located. The optimal estimate is obtained by "Try-
		and-error". It also provides routines for simulating first-,
		second-, and general-order glow peaks (or glow curves).
