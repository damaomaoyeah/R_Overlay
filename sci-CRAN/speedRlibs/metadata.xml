		Package containing the required libraries (jars) for speedR //
		speedRlibs is a container for the required libraries (jars) by
		speedR.  These libraries are packaged separately, because it is
		approximately 17 MB and will not be so often updated like
		speedR.  Thus it reduces the download time after the first
		installation.
