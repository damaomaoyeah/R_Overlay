		Bayesian Variable Selection with Hierarchical Priors // Bayesian
		variable selection for linear regression models using
		hierarchical priors. There is a prior that combines information
		across responses and one that combines information across
		covariates, as well as a standard spike and slab prior for
		comparison. An MCMC samples from the marginal posterior
		distribution for the 0-1 variables indicating if each covariate
		belongs to the model for each response.
