		Estimation of CCI and CLFS Functions // The currentSurvival
		package contains functions for the estimation of the current
		cumulative incidence (CCI) and the current leukaemia-free
		survival (CLFS). The CCI is the probability that a patient is
		alive and in any disease remission (e.g. complete cytogenetic
		remission in chronic myeloid leukaemia) after initiating his or
		her therapy (e.g. tyrosine kinase therapy for chronic myeloid
		leukaemia). The CLFS is the probability that a patient is alive
		and in any disease remission after achieving the first disease
		remission.
