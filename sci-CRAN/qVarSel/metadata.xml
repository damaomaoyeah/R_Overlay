		Variables Selection for Clustering and Classification // For a
		given data matrix A and cluster centers/prototypes collected in
		the matrix P, the functions described here select a subset of
		statistic variables Q that mostly explains/justifies P as
		prototypes. The functions are useful to reduce the data
		dimension for classification and to discard masking variables
		for clustering.
