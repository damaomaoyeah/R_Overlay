		Implementation of 2D Correlation Analysis // Implementation of
		two-dimensional (2D) correlation analysis based on the Fourier-
		transformation approach described by Isao Noda (I. Noda (1993)
		DOI:10.1366/0003702934067694). Additionally there are two plot
		functions for the resulting correlation matrix: The first one
		creates colored 2D plots, while the second one generates 3D
		plots.
