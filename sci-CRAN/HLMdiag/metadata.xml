		Diagnostic tools for hierarchical (multilevel) linear models // A
		suite of diagnostic tools for hierarchical (multilevel) linear
		models. The package offers not only leverage and traditional
		deletion diagnostics (Cook's distance, covratio, covtrace, and
		MDFFITS) but also provides convenience functions and graphics
		for residual analysis. The package assumes that models were fit
		using the lme4 package.
