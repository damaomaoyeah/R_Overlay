		Download, Clean and Generate New Variables from GSOD Data //
		Download, clean, reformat and create new variables from the USA
		National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) Global Surface Summary of
		the Day (GSOD) weather stations data,
		https://data.noaa.gov/dataset/global-surface-summary-of-the-
		day-gsod. The function, get_GSOD(), retrieves data from the
		GSOD ftp site and reformats it from United States Customary
		System (USCS) units to International System of Units (SI), also
		for convenience elevation is converted from decimetres to
		metres. Stations are individually checked for number of missing
		days, as defined by the user, to assure data quality. Stations
		with too many missing observations are omitted from final file.
		Stations with missing latitude or longitude or values for both
		of 0 are omitted. Also omitted are stations with a latitude of
		-90 or  90 or longitude of  - 180 or  180. Output is returned
		as a comma-separated values (CSV) file written to disk in a
		location selected by the user, which summarises each year by
		station and includes new variables: actual vapor pressure,
		saturation vapor pressure and relative humidity, calculated
		from the original GSOD data. The resulting files can be as
		large as 500mb depending on the user's stringency for missing
		data and geographic area of interest. Be sure to have
		sufficient RAM and disk space as well as a reasonably fast
		internet connection to use this package to perform this
		operation. However, for much smaller and more manageable data
		sets, an individual country of interest may be selected as well
		as only stations falling between -60/60 degrees latitude for
		agroclimatology work or individual stations if the station ID
		is known. The resulting files include station data (e.g.,
		station name, country, latitude, longitude, elevation) for use
		in a geographic information system (GIS). The function was
		largely based on T. Hengl's 'getGSOD.R' script, available from
		http://spatial-analyst.net/book/system/files/getGSOD.R with
		enhancements to be more cross-platform, faster and more
		flexible. For information on the original data from NCDC,
		please see the GSOD readme.txt file available from,
		http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt.
