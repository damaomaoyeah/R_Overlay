		Bayesian Bacterial Growth Curve Analysis in R // Babar is
		designed to use nested sampling (a Bayesian analysis technique)
		to compare possible models for bacterial growth curves, as well
		as extracting parameters. It allows model evidence and
		parameter likelihood values to be extracted, and also contains
		helper functions for comparing distributions as well as direct
		access to the underlying nested sampling code.
