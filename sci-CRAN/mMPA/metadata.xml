		Implementation of Marker-Assisted Mini-Pooling with Algorithm //
		To determine the number of quantitative assays needed for a
		sample of data using pooled testing methods, which include
		mini-pooling (MP), MP with algorithm (MPA), and marker-assisted
		MPA (mMPA). To estimate the number of assays needed, the
		package also provides a tool to conduct Monte Carlo (MC) to
		simulate different orders in which the sample would be
		collected to form pools. Using MC avoids the dependence of the
		estimated number of assays on any specific ordering of the
		samples to form pools.
