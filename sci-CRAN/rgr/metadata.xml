		Applied Geochemistry EDA // Geological Survey of Canada (GSC)
		functions for exploratory data analysis with applied
		geochemical data, with special application to the estimation of
		background ranges and identification of outliers, 'anomalies',
		to support mineral exploration and environmental studies.
		Additional functions are provided to support analytical data
		QA/QC, ANOVA for investigations of field sampling and
		analytical variability, and utility tasks.  NOTE: function
		caplot() for concentration-area plots employs package 'akima',
		however, 'akima' is only licensed for not-for-profit use.
		Therefore, not-for-profit users of 'rgr' will have to
		independently make package 'akima' available through
		library(....); and use of function caplot() by for-profit users
		will fail.
