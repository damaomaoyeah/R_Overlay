		Predicting Modulator and Functional/Survival Analysis // Predict
		modulators regulating the ability of effectors to regulate
		their targets and produce modulator-effector-target triplets
		followed by goterm functional enrichment and survival
		analysis.This is mainly applied to long non-coding RNAs
		(lncRNAs) as candidate modulators regulating the ability of
		transcription factors (TFs) to regulate their corresponding
		targets.
