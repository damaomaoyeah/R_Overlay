		Fit GLD Regression Model and GLD Quantile Regression Model to
		Empirical Data // Owing to the rich shapes of Generalised
		Lambda Distributions (GLDs), GLD standard/quantile regression
		is a competitive flexible model compared to standard/quantile
		regression.  The proposed method has some major advantages: 1)
		it provides a reference line which is very robust to outliers
		with the attractive property of zero mean residuals and 2) it
		gives a unified, elegant quantile regression model from the
		reference line with smooth regression coefficients across
		different quantiles. The goodness of fit of the proposed model
		can be assessed via QQ plots and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and
		data driven smooth test, to ensure the appropriateness of the
		statistical inference under consideration. Statistical
		distributions of coefficients of the GLD regression line are
		obtained using simulation, and interval estimates are obtained
		directly from simulated data.
