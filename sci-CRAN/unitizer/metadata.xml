		Interactive R Unit Tests // Simplifies regression tests by
		comparing objects produced by test code with earlier versions
		of those same objects.  If objects are unchanged the tests
		pass, otherwise execution stops with error details.  If in
		interactive mode, tests can be reviewed through the provided
		interactive environment.
