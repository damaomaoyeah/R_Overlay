		Secondary Trait Association analysis for Rare variants via
		SEQuence data // STARSEQ is an R-package for detecting
		associations with rare variants using selected samples in
		sequence-based association studies. It corrects for the bias in
		the secondary trait distribution induced by selective sampling
		on the primary trait. The corrected secondary trait can be
		analyzed by standard rare variant tests. In the STARSEQ
		package, several popular rare variant tests were implemented,
		which include 1.) combined multivariate and collapsing 2.)
		weighted sum statistics, 3.) kernel based adaptive cluster, 4.)
		variable threshold test 5.) sequence kernel association test.
