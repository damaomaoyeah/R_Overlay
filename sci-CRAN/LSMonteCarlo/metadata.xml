		American options pricing with Least Squares Monte Carlo method //
		The package compiles functions for calculating prices of
		American put options with Least Squares Monte Carlo method. The
		option types are plain vanilla American put, Asian American
		put, and Quanto American put. The pricing algorithms include
		variance reduction techniques such as Antithetic Variates and
		Control Variates. Additional functions are given to derive
		"price surfaces" at different volatilities and strikes, create
		3-D plots, quickly generate Geometric Brownian motion, and
		calculate prices of European options with Black  Scholes
		analytical solution.
