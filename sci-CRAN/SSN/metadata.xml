		Spatial Modeling on Stream Networks // Spatial statistical
		modeling and prediction for data on stream networks, including
		models based on in-stream distance.  Models are created using

		explanatory variables, can be fit with (restricted) maximum
		likelihood.  Mapping and other graphical functions are
