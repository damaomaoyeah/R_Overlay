		r2stl, R package for visualizing data using a 3D printer //
		r2stl, R package for visualizing data using a 3D printer
		Package r2stl converts R data to STL (stereolithography) files
		that can be used to feed a 3-dimensional printer.  The
		3-dimensional output from an R function can be materialized
		into a solid surface in a plastic material, therefore allowing
		more detailed examination. There are many possible uses for
		this new R tool, such as to examine mathematical expressions
		with very irregular shapes, to aid teaching people with
		impaired vision, to create raised relief maps from digital
		elevation maps (DEMs), to bridge the gap between mathematical
		tools and rapid prototyping, and many more.  Ian Walker created
		the function "r2stl" and Jose' Gama assembled the package.
