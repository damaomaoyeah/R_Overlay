		blockmatrix: Tools to solve algebraic systems with partitioned
		matrices // Some elementary matrix algebra tools are
		implemented to manage block matrices or partitioned matrix,
		i.e. "matrix of matrices"
		(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix). The block matrix
		is here defined as a new S3 object. In this package, some
		methods for "matrix" object are rewritten for "blockmatrix"
		object. New methods are implemented. This package was created
		to solve equation systems with block matrices for the analysis
		of environmental vector time series .
		Bugs/comments/questions/collaboration of any kind are warmly
		welcomed.
