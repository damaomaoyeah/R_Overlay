		Tools for Working with Rotation Data // Tools for working with
		rotational data, including simulation from the most commonly
		used distributions on SO(3), methods for different Bayes, mean
		and median type estimators for the central orientation of a
		sample, confidence/credible regions for the central orientation
		based on those estimators and a novel visualization technique
		for rotation data.  Most recently, functions to identify
		potentially discordant (outlying) values have been added.
