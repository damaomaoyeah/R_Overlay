		Genetics ToolboX // Assorted tools for genetic association
		analyses.  The current focus is on implementing (either exactly
		or approximately) regression analyses using summary statistics
		instead of using subject-specific data.  So far, functions
		exist to support multi-SNP risk score analyses, multi-SNP
		conditional regression analyses, and multi-phenotype analyses,
		using summary statistics.  There are helper functions for
		reading and manipulating subject-specific genotype data, which
		provide a platform for calculating the summary statistics, or
		for using R to conduct other analyses not supported by specific
		GWAS analysis tools.
