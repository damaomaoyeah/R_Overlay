		Individual-Based, Spatially-Explicit Simulation and Analysis of
		Multi-State Movements in River Networks and Heterogeneous
		Landscapes // Provides functions to generate and analyze
		individual-based spatially-explicit simulations of multi-state
		movements in heterogeneous landscapes, based on "resistance"
		rasters. Although originally conceived and designed to fill the
		gap of softwares simulating spatially-explicit trajectories of
		species constrained to linear, dendritic habitats (e.g., river
		networks), the simulation algorithm is built to be highly
		flexible and can be applied to any (aquatic, semi-aquatic or
		terrestrial) organism. Thus, the user will be able to use the
		package to simulate movements either in homogeneous landscapes,
		heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal in a
		riverscape), or even in highly contrasted landscapes (e.g. fish
		in a river network). The algorithm and its input parameters are
		the same for all cases, so that results are comparable.
		Simulated trajectories can then be used as null models to test
		e.g. for species site fidelity and other movement ecology
		hypotheses, or to build predictive, mechanistic movement
		models, among other things. The package should thus be relevant
		to explore a broad spectrum of ecological phenomena, such as
		those at the interface of animal behaviour, landscape, spatial
		and movement ecology, disease and invasive species spread, and
		population dynamics. This is the first released experimental
		version; do test before using in production.
