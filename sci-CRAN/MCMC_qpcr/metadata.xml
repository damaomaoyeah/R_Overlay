		Bayesian Analysis of qRT-PCR Data // Quantitative RT-PCR data are
		analyzed using generalized linear mixed models based on
		lognormal-Poisson error distribution, fitted using MCMC.
		Control genes are not required but can be incorporated as
		Bayesian priors or, when template abundances correlate with
		conditions, as trackers of global effects (common to all
		genes). The package also implements a lognormal model for
		higher-abundance data and a "classic" model involving multi-
		gene normalization on a by-sample basis. Several plotting
		functions are included to extract and visualize results. The
		detailed tutorial is available here: http://bit.ly/1Nwo4CB.
