		A GUI-based program to compute probabilities regarding group
		sequential designs. // The package provides a Tcl/Tk-based
		graphical user interface. It enables the construction of group
		sequential designs based on normally distributed test
		statistics, and particularly to compute critical boundaries,
		power, drift, and confidence intervals for such designs. All
		computations are done via the alpha spending approach by Lan-
		DeMets. Various alpha spending functions are made available to
		the user for this purpose.
