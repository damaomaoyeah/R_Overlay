		BAses GIving DIStances // This is the companion package of a PhD
		thesis entitled "Bases Giving Distances. A new paradigm for
		investigating functional data with applications for
		spectroscopy" by Timmermans (2012). See references for details
		and related publications. The core of the BAGIDIS methodology
		is a functional wavelet based semi-distance that has been
		introduced by Timmermans and von Sachs (2010, 2015) and
		Timmermans, Delsol and von Sachs (2013). This semi-distance
		allows for comparing curves with sharp local patterns that
		might not be well aligned from one curve to another. It is
		data-driven and highly adaptive to the curves being studied.
		Its main originality is its ability to consider simultaneously
		horizontal and vertical variations of patterns, which proofs
		highly useful when used together with clustering algorithms or
		visualization method. BAGIDIS is an acronym for BAsis GIving
		DIStances. The extension of BAGIDIS to image data relies on the
		same principles and has been described in Timmermans and
		Fryzlewicz (2012), Fryzlewicz and Timmermans (2015).
