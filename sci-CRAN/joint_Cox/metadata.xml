		Penalized Likelihood Estimation and Dynamic Prediction under the
		Joint Frailty-Copula Models Between Tumour Progression and
		Death for Meta-Analysis // Perform the Cox regression and
		dynamic prediction under the joint frailty-copula model between
		tumour progression and death for meta-analysis. The method is
		applicable for meta-analytic data combining several studies.
		The data should have information on both terminal event time
		(e.g., time-to-death) and non-terminal event time (e.g., time-
		to-tumour progression).
