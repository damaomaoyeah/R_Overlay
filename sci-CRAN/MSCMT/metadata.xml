		Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series //
		Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series. Two
		generalizations of the synthetic control method (which has
		already an implementation in package 'Synth') are implemented:
		first, 'MSCMT' allows for using multiple outcome variables,
		second, time series can be supplied as economic predictors.
		Much effort has been taken to make the implementation as stable
		as possible (including edge cases) without losing computational
		efficiency.
