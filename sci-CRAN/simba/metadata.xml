		A Collection of functions for similarity analysis of vegetation
		data // Besides functions for the calculation of similarity and
		multiple plot similarity measures with binary data (for
		instance presence/absence species data) the package contains
		some simple wrapper functions for reshaping species lists into
		matrices and vice versa and some other functions for further
		processing of similarity data (Mantel-like permutation
		procedures) as well as some other useful stuff for vegetation
		analysis.
