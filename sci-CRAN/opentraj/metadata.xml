		Tools for Creating and Analysing Air Trajectory Data // opentraj
		uses the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated
		Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) for computing simple air parcel
		trajectories. The functions in this package allow users to run
		HYSPLIT for trajectory calculations, as well as get its
		results, directly from R without using any GUI interface.
