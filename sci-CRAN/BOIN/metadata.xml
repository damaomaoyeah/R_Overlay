		Bayesian Optimal Interval Design for Phase I Clinical Trials //
		The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I
		clinical trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose
		(MTD). The BOIN design is motivated by the top priority and
		concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to
		effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing
		them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent
		advantage of the BOIN design is that it achieves simplicity and
		superior performance at the same time. The BOIN design is
		algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar
		to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields average
		performance comparable to the continual reassessment method
		(CRM, one of the best model-based design) in terms of selecting
		the MTD, but has a substantially lower risk of assigning
		patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.
