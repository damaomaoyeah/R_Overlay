		Goodness of Fit Noise Analysis Using Monte Carlo Techniques //
		Goodness-of-fit metrics, such as R-Squared, RMSE, etc., share a
		sensitivity to noise, dependent on the degrees of freedom.
		Some metrics, such as R-Squared, decrease with increasing dof
		and some, such as RMSE, increase with increasing dof.  This
		package calculates the noise baseline (ceiling) by random
		sampling, calculating the metrics value for each sample and
		counting the number of samples below a desired level, 95% by
		default. If ones measure is above (below) the calculation
		corresponding to the desired level, then the measurement is
		distinguishable from noise.  In addition, the ratio of the
		measurement to the calculated level provides a way to compare
		measurements of different degrees of freedom.
