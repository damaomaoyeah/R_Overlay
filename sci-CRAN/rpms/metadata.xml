		Recursive Partitioning for Modeling Survey Data // Fits a linear
		model to survey data in each node obtained by recursively
		partitioning the data.  The splitting variables and splits
		selected are obtained using a procedure which adjusts for
		complex sample design features used to obtain the data.
		Likewise the model fitting algorithm produces design-consistent
		coefficients to the least squares linear model between the
		dependent and independent variables. The first stage of the
		design is accounted for in the provided variance estimates. The
		main function returns the resulting binary tree with the linear
		model fit at every endnode as an R object of class "rpms". The
		package provides a number of functions and methods for this
		rpms class.
