		Data exploration tools from Yale University. // This collection
		of data exploration tools was developed at Yale University for
		the graphical exploration of complex multivariate data; barcode
		and gpairs now have their own packages.  The new
		big.read.table() provided here may be useful for large files
		when only a subset is needed.
