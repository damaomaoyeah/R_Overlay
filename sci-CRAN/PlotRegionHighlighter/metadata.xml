		Creates an envelope that surrounds a set of points plotted in a
		two dimensional space. // Creates an envelope around a set of
		plotted points. The envelope is compact with a boundary that is
		continuous, smooth and convex. Each point is represented as a
		circle and the circles and connecting lines are the solution to
		the multiple pulley problem. This method can be used to
		highlight regions in a two-dimensional space.
