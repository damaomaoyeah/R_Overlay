		Compare Groups, Analytically and Graphically // Comprehensive
		data analysis software, and the name "cg" stands for "compare
		groups." Its genesis and evolution are driven by common needs
		to compare administrations, conditions, etc. in medicine
		research and development. The current version provides
		comparisons of unpaired samples, i.e. a linear model with one
		factor of at least two levels. It also provides comparisons of
		two paired samples. Good data graphs, modern statistical
		methods, and useful displays of results are emphasized.
