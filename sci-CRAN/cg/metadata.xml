		The cg package to compare groups // cg is comprehensive data
		analysis software, and stands for "compare groups." Its genesis
		and evolution are driven by common needs to compare
		administrations, conditions, etc. in medicine research
		development. The current version provides comparisons of
		unpaired samples, i.e. a linear model with one factor of at
		least two levels. It also provides comparisons of two paired
		samples. Good data graphs, modern statistical methods, and
		useful displays of results are emphasized.
