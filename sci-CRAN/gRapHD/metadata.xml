		Efficient selection of undirected graphical models for high-
		dimensional datasets // gRapHD is designed for efficient
		selection of high-dimensional undirected graphical models. The
		package provides tools for selecting trees, forests and
		decomposable models minimizing information criteria such as AIC
		or BIC, and for displaying the independence graphs of the
		models. It has also some useful tools for analysing graphical
		structures. It supports the use of discrete, continuous, or
		both types of variables.
