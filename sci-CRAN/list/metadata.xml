		Statistical Methods for the Item Count Technique and List
		Experiment // Allows researchers to conduct multivariate
		statistical analyses of survey data with list experiments. This
		survey methodology is also known as the item count technique or
		the unmatched count technique and is an alternative to the
		commonly used randomized response method. The package
		implements the methods developed by Imai (2011), Blair and Imai
		(2012), Blair, Imai, and Lyall (2013), Imai, Park, and Greene
		(2014), and Aronow, Coppock, Crawford, and Green (2015). This
		includes a Bayesian MCMC implementation of regression for the
		standard and multiple sensitive item list experiment designs
		and a random effects setup, a Bayesian MCMC hierarchical
		regression model with up to three hierarchical groups, the
		combined list experiment and endorsement experiment regression
		model, a joint model of the list experiment that enables the
		analysis of the list experiment as a predictor in outcome
		regression models, and a method for combining list experiments
		with direct questions. In addition, the package implements the
		statistical test that is designed to detect certain failures of
		list experiments, and a placebo test for the list experiment
		using data from direct questions.
