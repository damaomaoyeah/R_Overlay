		Statistical Methods for the Item Count Technique and List
		Experiment // list is a publicly available R package that
		allows researchers to conduct multivariate statistical analyses
		of survey data with list experiments. In addition, the package
		implements the statistical test that is designed to detect
		certain failures of list experiments. This survey methodology
		is also known as the item count technique or the unmatched
		count technique and is an alternative to the commonly used
		randomized response method. The package implements the methods
		developed by Imai (2011), Blair and Imai (2012), Blair, Imai,
		and Lyall (2013), and Imai, Park, and Greene (2014). This
		includes a Bayesian MCMC implementation of regression for the
		standard and multiple sensitive item list experiment designs
		and a random effects setup, a Bayesian MCMC hierarchical
		regression model with up to three hierarchical groups, the
		combined list experiment and endorsement experiment regression
		model, and a joint model of the list experiment that enables
		the analysis of the list experiment as a predictor in outcome
		regression models.
