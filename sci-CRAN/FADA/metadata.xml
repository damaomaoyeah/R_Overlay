		Variable Selection for Supervised Classification in High
		Dimension // The functions provided in the FADA (Factor
		Adjusted Discriminant Analysis) package aim at performing
		supervised classification of high-dimensional and correlated
		profiles. The procedure combines a decorrelation step based on
		a factor modeling of the dependence among covariates and a
		classification method. The available methods are Lasso
		regularized logistic model (see Friedman et al. (2010)), sparse
		linear discriminant analysis (see Clemmensen et al. (2011)),
		shrinkage linear and diagonal discriminant analysis (see M.
		Ahdesmaki et al. (2010)). More methods of classification can be
		used on the decorrelated data provided by the package FADA.
