		Reddit Data Extraction Toolkit // Reddit is an online bulletin
		board and a social networking website where registered users
		can submit and discuss content. This package uses Reddit API to
		extract Reddit data using Reddit API. The retrieved data has
		flat structure, i.e. the relationship between comments is not
		preserved.This may be addressed in the next update of this
		package. Note that due to the API limitations, the number of
		comments that can extracted is limited to 500 per thread. The
		package consists of 3 functions, one for extracting relevant
		URLS, one for extracting features out of given URLs and one
		that does both together.
