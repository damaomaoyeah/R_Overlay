		Reddit Data Extraction Toolkit // Reddit is an online bulletin
		board and a social networking website where registered users
		can submit and discuss content. This package uses Reddit API to
		extract Reddit data using Reddit API. Note that due to the API
		limitations, the number of comments that can extracted is
		limited to 500 per thread. The package consists of 4 functions,
		one for extracting relevant URLs, one for extracting features
		out of given URLs, one that does both together and one that
		constructs graphs based on the structure of a thread.
