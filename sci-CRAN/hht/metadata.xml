		The Hilbert-Huang Transform: Tools and Methods // This package
		builds on the EMD package to provide additional tools for
		empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral
		analysis. It also implements the ensemble empirical
		decomposition (EEMD) and the complete ensemble empirical mode
		decomposition (CEEMD) methods to avoid mode mixing and
		intermittency problems found in EMD analysis.  The package
		comes with several plotting methods that can be used to view
		intrinsic mode functions, the HHT spectrum, and the Fourier
		spectrum. To see the version history and download the bleeding-
		edge version (at your own risk!), see the project website at
		code.google.com below.  See the other links for PDF files
		describing numerical and exact analytical methods for
		determining instantaneous frequency, some examples of signals
		processed with this package, and some examples of the ensemble
		empirical mode decomposition method.
