		The Hilbert-Huang Transform: Tools and Methods // Builds on the
		EMD package to provide additional tools for empirical mode
		decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert spectral analysis. It also
		implements the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) and the
		complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) methods
		to avoid mode mixing and intermittency problems found in EMD
		analysis.  The package comes with several plotting methods that
		can be used to view intrinsic mode functions, the HHT spectrum,
		and the Fourier spectrum.
