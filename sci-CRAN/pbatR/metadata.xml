		P2BAT // This package provides data analysis via the pbat
		program, and an alternative internal implementation of the
		power calculations via simulation only.  For analysis, this
		package provides a frontend to the PBAT software, automatically
		reading in the output from the pbat program and displaying the
		corresponding figure when appropriate (i.e. PBAT-logrank). It
		includes support for multiple processes and clusters. For
		analysis, users must download PBAT (developed by Christoph
		Lange) and accept it's license, available on the PBAT webpage.
		Both the data analysis and power calculations have command line
		and graphical interfaces using tcltk.
