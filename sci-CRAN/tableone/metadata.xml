		Create "Table 1" to describe baseline characteristics // This
		package creates "Table 1", i.e., description of baseline
		patient characteristics, which is essential in every medical
		research. This package provides functions to create such
		summaries for continuous and categorical variables, optionally
		with subgroup comparisons. The package was inspired by and
		based on descriptive statistics functions in Deducer, a Java-
		based GUI package by Ian Fellows. This package does not require
		GUI or Java, and intended for command-line users.
