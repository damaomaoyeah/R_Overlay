		Design of experiments for detection of linkage disequilibrium //
		R package for design of experiments for design of genome-wide
		association studies.  Version 2 incorporating quantitative
		traits and case-control studies. The Bayes factor should be
		chosen large enough to give respectable posterior odds. This
		requires Bayes factors of the order of 10^6 in genome-wide
		association studies where prior odds are low. Sample sizes
		needed to get this strength of evidence are substantially
		higher than those from traditional power calculations. The
		corresponding threshold for p-values is substantially lower
		than commonly used.  For quantitative traits ldDesign uses an
		existing deterministic power calculation for detection of
		linkage disequilibrium between a bi-allelic QTL and a bi-
		allelic marker, together with the Spiegelhalter and Smith Bayes
		factor to generate designs with power to detect effects with a
		given Bayes factor. For case- control studies an asymptotic
		approximate Bayes factor is used to derive an analytical power
		calculation in dominant, recessive, additive and general
		genetic models.
