		Evaluation of stratified genome-wide association meta-analysis
		results // This is a pipelining tool that facilitates
		evaluation and visualisation of stratified genome-wide
		association meta-analyses (GWAMAs) results data. It provides
		(i) statistical methods to test and to account for between-
		strata difference and to clump genome-wide results into
		independent loci and (ii) extended graphical features (e.g.,
		Manhattan, Miami and QQ plots) tailored for stratified GWAMA
		results.
