		Penalized Multinomial Logistic Regression // Extends the approach
		proposed by Firth (1993) for bias reduction of MLEs in
		exponential family models to the multinomial logistic
		regression model with general covariate types.  Modification of
		the logistic regression score function to remove first-order
		bias is equivalent to penalizing the likelihood by the Jeffreys
		prior, and yields penalized maximum likelihood estimates (PLEs)
		that always exist.  Hypothesis testing is conducted via
		likelihood ratio statistics.  Profile confidence intervals (CI)
		are constructed for the PLEs.
