		Estimation of Distribution Algorithms Based on Copulas //
		Provides a platform where EDAs (estimation of distribution
		algorithms) based on copulas can be implemented and studied.
		The package offers complete implementations of various EDAs
		based on copulas and vines, a group of well-known optimization
		problems, and utility functions to study the performance of the
		algorithms. Newly developed EDAs can be easily integrated into
		the package by extending an S4 class with generic functions for
		their main components.
