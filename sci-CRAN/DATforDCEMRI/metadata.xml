		Deconvolution Analysis Tool for Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI //
		This package performs voxel-wise deconvolution analysis of DCE-
		MRI contrast agent concentration versus time data and generates
		the Impulse Response Function, which can be used to approximate
		commonly utilized kinetic parameters such as Ktrans and ve.  An
		interactive advanced voxel diagnosis tool (AVDT) is also
		provided to facilitate easy navigation of voxel-wise data.
