		Implementation of Smart SVA // Introduces a fast and efficient
		Surrogate Variable Analysis algorithm that captures variation
		of unknown sources (batch effects) for high-dimensional genomic
		data. The algorithm is based on the popular 'SVA' package and
		proposes a revision on it that achieves more than 10 times
		faster running time while trading no accuracy loss in return.
