		Tools for tensor analysis and decomposition // rTensor is a set
		of tools for creation, manipulation, and modeling of tensors
		with arbitrary number of modes. A tensor in the context of data
		analysis is a multidimensional array. rTensor does this by
		providing a S4 class 'Tensor' that wraps around the base
		'array' class. rTensor also provides common tensor operations
		as methods, including matrix unfolding, summing/averaging
		across modes, calculating the Frobenius norm, and taking the
		inner product between two tensors. Familiar array operations
		are overloaded, such as index subsetting via '[' and element-
		wise operations. rTensor also implements various tensor
		decomposition, including CP, GLRAM, MPCA, PVD, and Tucker. For
		tensors with 3 modes, rTensor also implements transpose,
		product, and SVD, as defined in Kilmer et al. (2013). Some
		auxiliary functions include the Khatri-Rao product, Kronecker
		product, and the Hamadard product for a list of matrices.
		Development of rTensor has been generously supported by
		Cornell's Department of Statistical Science.
