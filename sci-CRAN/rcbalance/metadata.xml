		Large, Sparse Optimal Matching with Refined Covariate Balance //
		Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units and
		control units in observational studies.  Provisions are made
		for refined covariate balance constraints, which include fine
		and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are optimal in
		the sense that they are computed as solutions to network
		optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms.
