		Multidimensional Item Response Theory // Analysis of dichotomous
		and polytomous response data using unidimensional and
		multidimensional latent trait models under the Item Response
		Theory paradigm. Exploratory and confirmatory models can be
		estimated with quadrature (EM) or stochastic (MHRM) methods.
		Confirmatory bi-factor and two-tier analyses are available for
		modeling item testlets. Multiple group analysis and mixed
		effects designs also are available for detecting differential
		item and test functioning as well as modelling item and person
		covariates.
