		Inequality constrained inference in linear normal situations //
		This package implements parameter estimation in normal (linear)
		models under linear equality and inequality constraints and
		implements normal likelihood ratio tests involving inequality-
		constrained hypotheses. For inequality-constrained linear
		models, averaging over R-squared for different orderings of
		regressors is also included.
