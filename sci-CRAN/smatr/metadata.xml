		(Standardised) Major Axis Estimation and Testing Routines // This
		package provides methods of fitting bivariate lines in
		allometry using the major axis (MA) or standardised major axis
		(SMA), and for making inferences about such lines. The
		available methods of inference include confidence intervals and
		one-sample tests for slope and elevation, testing for a common
		slope or elevation amongst several allometric lines,
		constructing a confidence interval for a common slope or
		elevation, and testing for no shift along a common axis,
		amongst several samples.
