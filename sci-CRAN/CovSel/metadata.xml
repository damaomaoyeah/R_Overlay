		Model-Free Covariate Selection // Model-free selection of
		covariates under unconfoundedness for situations where the
		parameter of interest is an average causal effect. This package
		is based on  model-free backward elimination algorithms
		proposed in de Luna, Waernbaum and Richardson (2011). Marginal
		co-ordinate hypothesis testing is used in situations where all
		covariates are continuous while kernel-based smoothing
		appropriate for mixed data is used otherwise.
