		Semiparametric factor and regression models for symmetric
		relational data // This package estimates the parameters of a
		model for symmetric relational data (e.g., the above-diagonal
		part of a square matrix), using a model-based eigenvalue
		decomposition and regression. Missing data is accomodated, and
		a posterior mean for missing data is calculated under the
		assumption that the data are missing at random. The marginal
		distribution of the relational data can be arbitrary, and is
		fit with an ordered probit specification.
