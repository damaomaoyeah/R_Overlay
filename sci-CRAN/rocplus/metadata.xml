		ROC, Precision-Recall, Convex Hull and other plots. // Creates
		single and multiple ROC plots, precision-recall, Bayes plots
		and others. The plots may be either rough or smooth with
		confidence limits. Threshold values, optimum points and other
		interesting points may be marked on the plots. The convex hull
		for multiple curves with blending fractions for interesting
		points may be obtained. The axes may have normal or lognormal
		scaling.
