		Record Linkage, Incorporating Imputation for Missing Agreement
		Patterns, and Modeling Correlation Patterns Between Fields // A
		matrix of agreement patterns and counts for record pairs is the
		input for the procedure.  An EM algorithm is used to impute
		plausible values for missing record pairs.  A second EM
		algorithm, incorporating possible correlations between per-
		field agreement, is used to estimate posterior probabilities
		that each pair is a true match - i.e. constitutes the same
		individual.
