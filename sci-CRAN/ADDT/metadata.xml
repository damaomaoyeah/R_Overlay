		A Package for Analysis of Accelerated Destructive Degradation
		Test Data // Accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDT)
		are often used to collect necessary data for assessing the
		long-term properties of polymeric materials. Based on the
		collected data, a thermal index (TI) is estimated. The TI can
		be useful for material rating and comparison. This package
		performs the least squares (LS) and maximum likelihood (ML)
		procedures for estimating TI for polymeric materials. The LS
		approach is a two-step approach that is currently used in
		industrial standards, while the ML procedure is widely used in
		the statistical literature. The ML approach allows one to do
		statistical inference such as quantifying uncertainties in
		estimation, hypothesis testing, and predictions. Two publicly
		available datasets are provided to allow users to experiment
		and practice with the functions.
