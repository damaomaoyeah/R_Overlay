		Delayed-Data Packages // Create and maintain delayed-data
		packages (ddp's).  Data stored in a ddp are available on
		demand, but do not take up memory until requested. You attach a
		ddp with g.data.attach(), then read from it and assign to it in
		a manner similar to S-PLUS, except that you must run
		g.data.save() to actually commit to disk.
