		R Package for Ridge Fusion in Statistical Learning // This
		package implements ridge fusion methodology for inverse
		covariance matrix estimation for use in quadratic discriminant
		analysis.  The package also contains function for model based
		clustering using ridge fusion for inverse matrix estimation, as
		well as tuning parameter selection functions.  We have also
		implemented QDA using joint inverse covariance estimation.
