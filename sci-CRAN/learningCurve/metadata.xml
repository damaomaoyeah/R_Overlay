		An Implementation of Crawford's and Wright's Learning Curve
		Production Functions // Implements common learning curve
		production functions. It incorporates Crawford's and Wright's
		learning curve functions to compute unit and cumulative block
		estimates for time (or cost) of units along with an aggregate
		learning curve. It also provides delta and error functions and
		some basic learning curve plotting functions.along with
		functions to compute aggregated learning curves, error rates,
		and to visualize learning curves.
