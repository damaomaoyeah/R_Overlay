		Generate PDFs and CDFs from Binned Data // Provides several
		methods for generating density functions based on binned data.
		Data are assumed to be nonnegative, but the bin widths need not
		be uniform, and the top bin may be unbounded. All PDF smoothing
		methods maintain the areas specified by the binned data.
		(Equivalently, all CDF smoothing methods interpolate the points
		specified by the binned data.) An estimate for the mean of the
		distribution may be supplied as an optional argument, which
		greatly improves the reliability of statistics computed from
		the smoothed density functions. Methods include step function,
		recursive subdivision, and optimized spline.
