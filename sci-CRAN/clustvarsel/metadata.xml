		Variable Selection for Model-Based Clustering // A function which
		implements variable selection methodology for model-based
		clustering which allows to find the (locally) optimal subset of
		variables  in a data set that have group/cluster information. A
		greedy or headlong search can be used, either in a forward-
		backward or backward-forward direction, with or without sub-
		sampling at the hierarchical clustering stage for starting
		MCLUST models. By default the algorithm uses a sequential
		search, but parallelization is also available.
