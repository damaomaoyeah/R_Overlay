		Significance analysis of sequencing data based on a Poisson log
		linear model // This package implements a method for
		normalization, testing, and false discovery rate estimation for
		RNA-sequencing data. The description of the method is in Li J,
		Witten DM, Johnstone I, Tibshirani R (2012). Normalization,
		testing, and false discovery rate estimation for RNA-sequencing
		data. Biostatistics 13(3): 523-38. We estimate the sequencing
		depths of experiments using a new method based on Poisson
		goodness-of-fit statistic, calculate a score statistic on the
		basis of a Poisson log-linear model, and then estimate the
		false discovery rate using a modified version of permutation
		plug-in method. A more detailed instruction as well as sample
		data is available at
		http://www.stanford.edu/~junli07/research.html.  In this
		version, we changed the way of calculating log foldchange for
		two-class data. The FDR estimation part remains unchanged.
