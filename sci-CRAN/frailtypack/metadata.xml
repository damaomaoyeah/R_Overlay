		General Frailty Models: Shared, Joint and Nested Frailty Models
		with Prediction // The following several classes of frailty
		models using a penalized likelihood estimation on the hazard
		function but also a parametric estimation can be fit using this
		R package: 1) A shared frailty model (with gamma or log-normal
		frailty distribution) and Cox proportional hazard model.
		Clustered and recurrent survival times can be studied. 2)
		Additive frailty models for proportional hazard models with two
		correlated random effects (intercept random effect with random
		slope). 3) Nested frailty models for hierarchically clustered
		data (with 2 levels of clustering) by including two iid gamma
		random effects. 4) Joint frailty models in the context of joint
		modelling for recurrent events with terminal event for
		clustered data or not. 5) Joint General frailty models in the
		context of a joint modelling for recurrent events with terminal
		event data with two independent frailty terms. Prediction
		values are available. Left-truncated (not for Joint model),
		right-censored data, interval-censored data (only for Cox
		proportional hazard and shared frailty model) and strata are
		allowed. In each model, the random effects have a gamma
		distribution, but you can switch to a log-normal in shared and
		joint models. Now, you can also consider time-varying
		covariates effects in Cox, shared and joint models. The package
		includes concordance measures for Cox proportional hazards
		models and for shared frailty models.
