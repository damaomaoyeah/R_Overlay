		Human readable data presentation // This package provides clear,
		informative and colorful ways of presenting the contents of
		data.frame, list, environment etc. in the prompt. Ideally this
		package should be used in terminals supporting xterm 256 colour
		mode, e.g. the standard Ubuntu terminal. The Mac OS X terminal
		(as of Snow Leopard) only support ANSI colour, which still
		works but doesn't look as nice. On Windows systems no colouring
		is supported. If the output of functions like 'whos' is a mess
		or somehow doesn't look like it should check the help for the
		functions 'style' and 'style.mode' of the 'xtermStyle' package.
