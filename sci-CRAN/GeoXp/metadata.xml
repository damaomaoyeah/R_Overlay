		Interactive exploratory spatial data analysis // GeoXp is a tool
		for researchers in spatial statistics, spatial econometrics,
		geography, ecology etc allowing to link dynamically statistical
		plots with elementary maps. This coupling consists in the fact
		that the selection of a zone on the map results in the
		automatic highlighting of the corresponding points on the
		statistical graph or reversely the selection of a portion of
		the graph results in the automatic highlighting of the
		corresponding points on the map. GeoXp includes tools from
		different areas of spatial statistics including geostatistics
		as well as spatial econometrics and point processes. Besides
		elementary plots like boxplots, histograms or simple
		scatterplot, GeoXp also couples with maps Moran scatterplots,
		variogram cloud, Lorentz Curves,...In order to make the most of
		the multidimensionality of the data, GeoXp includes some
		dimension reduction techniques such as PCA.
