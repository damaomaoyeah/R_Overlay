		Tools for Chromatographic Column Characterization and Modelling
		Chromatographic Peak // The quantitative measurement and
		detection of molecules in HPLC should be carried out by an
		accurate description of chromatographic peaks. In this package
		non-linear fitting using a modified Gaussian model with a
		parabolic variance (PVMG) has been implemented to obtain the
		retention time and height at the peak maximum. This package
		also includes the traditional Van Deemter approach and two
		alternatives approaches to characterize chromatographic column.
