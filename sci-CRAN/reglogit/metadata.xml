		Simulation-based Regularized Logistic Regression // Regularized
		(polychotomous) logistic regression by Gibbs sampling. The
		package implements subtly different MCMC schemes with varying
		efficiency depending on the data type (binary v. binomial, say)
		and the desired estimator (regularized maximum likelihood, or
		Bayesian maximum a posteriori/posterior mean, etc.) through a
		unified interface.
