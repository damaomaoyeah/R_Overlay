		Basic Wireless Communications // A basic wireless communications
		simulation package in R. The package includes modulation
		functions for BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM. Also
		included is an AWGN noise generation function. Additionally,
		the package includes functions to plot an I (in-phase) and Q
		(quadrature) scatter diagram, or density plot. Together these
		functions enable the evaluation of respective bit error and
		symbol rates in an AWGN channel and for easily viewing the
		respective signals and noise in a scatter plot or density plot.
