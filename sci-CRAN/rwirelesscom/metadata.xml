		Basic Wireless Communications Simulation // A communications
		simulation package supporting common wireless modulation
		formats including BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-PSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM.
		The package includes AWGN noise generation, and raised cosine
		and square root raised cosine pulse shaping. It also includes
		convenience functions for plotting constellation diagrams,
		density plots, stem plots and eye diagrams. Together these
		functions enable the evaluation of bit error and symbol error
		rates, evaluation of pulse shaping and inter-symbol
		interference and support visualization of the respective
		signals and noise in a variety of formats.
