		Training of neural networks // Training of neural networks using
		backpropagation, resilient backpropagation with (Riedmiller,
		1994) or without weight backtracking (Riedmiller and Braun,
		1993) or the modified globally convergent version by
		Anastasiadis et al. (2005). The package allows flexible
		settings through custom-choice of error and activation
		function. Furthermore, the calculation of generalized weights
		(Intrator O  Intrator N, 1993) is implemented.
