		R interface to the UNU.RAN random variate generators // Interface
		to the UNU.RAN library for Universal Non-Uniform RANdom variate
		generators. Thus it allows to build non-uniform random number
		generators from quite arbitrary distributions. In particular,
		it provides an algorithm for fast numerical inversion for
		distribution with given density function. In addition, the
		package contains densities, distribution functions and
		quantiles from a couple of distributions.
