		Interaction Prediction Between Groundwater and Quarry Extension
		Using Discrete Choice Models and Artificial Neural Networks //
		An implementation of two interaction indices between extractive
		activity and groundwater resources based on hazard and
		vulnerability parameters used in the assessment of natural
		hazards. One index is based on a discrete choice model and the
		other is relying on an artificial neural network.
