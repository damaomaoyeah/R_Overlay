		Plotting longitudinal series // Aim: Adjust the graphical
		parameters to create nicer longitudinal series plots. The
		default set of graphical parameters is very general, and can be
		improved upon when we are interested in plotting data points
		observed over time. Functions facilitate plotting those kind of
		series, univariate plots, bivariate plots (with vertical axis
		on both left and right hand sides), multivariate plots and
		plots which allow to examine whether a new observation is
		'unusual' via construction and visualization of prediction
		intervals around it.
