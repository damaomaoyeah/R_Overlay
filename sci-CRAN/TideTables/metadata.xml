		Tide Analysis and Prediction of Predominantly Semi-Diurnal Tides
		// Tide analysis and prediction of predominantly semi-diurnal
		tides with two high waters and two low waters during one lunar
		day (~24.842 hours, ~1.035 days). The analysis should
		preferably cover an observation period of at least 19 years.
		For shorter periods, for example, the nodal cycle can not be
		taken into account, which particularly affects the height
		calculation. The main objective of this package is to produce
		tide tables.
