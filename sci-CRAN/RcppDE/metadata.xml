		Global Optimization by Differential Evolution in C++ // An
		efficient C++ based implementation of the 'DEoptim' function
		which performs global optimization by differential evolution.
		Its creation was motivated by trying to see if the old
		approximation "easier, shorter, faster: pick any two" could in
		fact be extended to achieving all three goals while moving the
		code from plain old C to modern C++.  The initial version did
		in fact do so, but a good part of the gain was due to an
		implicit code review which eliminated a few inefficiencies
		which have since been eliminated in 'DEoptim'.
