		Fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model // Conduct inference about
		generalized linear mixed models, with a choice about which
		method to use to approximate the likelihood. In addition to the
		Laplace and adaptive Gaussian quadrature approximations, which
		are borrowed from 'lme4', the likelihood may be approximated by
		the sequential reduction approximation, or an importance
		sampling approximation. These methods provide an accurate
		approximation to the likelihood in some situations where it is
		not possible to use adaptive Gaussian quadrature.
