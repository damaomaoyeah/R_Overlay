		Batch Effects Removal // The functions in this package remove
		batch effects from microarrary normalized data. The expression
		levels of the genes are represented in a matrix where rows
		correspond to independent samples and columns to genes
		(variables). The batches are represented by categorical
		variables (objects of class factor). When further covariates of
		interest are available they can be used to remove efficiently
		the batch effects and adjust the data.
