		White Matter Normalization for Magnetic Resonance Images using
		Whitestripe // Shinohara et. al introduced Whitestripe, an
		intensity-based normalization of T1 and T2 images, where normal
		appearing white matter performs well, but requires
		segmentation. This method performs white matter mean and
		standard deviation estimates on data that has been rigidly-
		registered to the MNI template and uses histogram-based
		methods.
