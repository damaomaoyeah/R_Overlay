		Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Models // Implements
		methods described by the paper Robins and Tsiatis (1991)
		DOI:10.1080/03610929108830654. These use g-estimation to
		estimate the causal effect of a treatment in a two-armed
		randomised control trial where non-compliance exists and is
		measured, under an assumption of an accelerated failure time
		model and no unmeasured confounders.
