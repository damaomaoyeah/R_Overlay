		Statistical Analysis of High Throughput Proteomics Data //
		Provides methods for making inference in isobaric labelled LC-
		MS/MS experiments, i.e. iTRAQ experiments. It provides a
		function that reasonably parses a CSV-export from Proteome
		Discoverer(TM) into a data frame that can be easily handled in
		R. Functions and methods are provided for quality control,
		filtering, norming, and the calculation of response variables
		for further analysis. The merging of multiple iTRAQ experiments
		with respect to a reference is also covered.
