		an automated algorithm to mark Actigraph accelerometer data as
		either bedrest or active.  There are separate functions for
		waist and wrist data.  Its input is a dataframe with a
		timestamp column and one of counts.  The output is the same
		dataframe with an additional column, bedrest.  Bedrest will
		have "a" active or "br" for each line.  Options also allow for
		"n" nap which only differ than "s" in being for a shorter
		(specifiable) time period.  Designed to be used after
