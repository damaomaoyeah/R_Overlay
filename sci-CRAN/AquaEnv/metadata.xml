		Integrated Development Toolbox for Aquatic Chemical Model
		Generation // Toolbox for the experimental aquatic chemist,
		focused on acidification and CO2 air-water exchange. It
		contains all elements to model the pH, the related CO2 air-
		water exchange, and aquatic acid-base chemistry for an
		arbitrary marine, estuarine or freshwater system. It contains a
		suite of tools for sensitivity analysis, visualisation,
		modelling of chemical batches, and can be used to build dynamic
		models of aquatic systems. As from version 1.0-4, it also
		contains functions to calculate the buffer factors.
