		RCEIM - R Cross Entropy Inspired Method for Optimization // RCEIM
		is a package implementing a stochastic heuristic method for
		performing multidimensional function optimization. The method
		is inspired in the Cross-Entropy Method. It does not relies on
		derivatives, neither imposes particularly strong requirements
		into the function to be optimized. Additionally, it takes
		profit from multicore processing to enable optimization of
		time-consuming functions.
