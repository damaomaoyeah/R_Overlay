		R Cross Entropy Inspired Method for Optimization // An
		implementation of a stochastic heuristic method for performing
		multidimensional function optimization. The method is inspired
		in the Cross-Entropy Method. It does not relies on derivatives,
		neither imposes particularly strong requirements into the
		function to be optimized. Additionally, it takes profit from
		multi-core processing to enable optimization of time-consuming
		functions.
