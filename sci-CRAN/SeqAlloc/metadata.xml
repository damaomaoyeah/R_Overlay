		Sequential Allocation for Prospective Experiments // Potential
		randomization schemes are prospectively evaluated when units
		are assigned to treatment arms upon entry into the experiment.
		The schemes are evaluated for balance on covariates and on
		predictability (i.e., how well could a site worker guess the
		treatment of the next unit enrolled).
