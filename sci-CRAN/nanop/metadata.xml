		Tools for Nanoparticle Simulation and Calculation of PDF and
		Total Scattering Structure Function // This software package
		implements functions to simulate spherical, ellipsoid and cubic
		polyatomic nanoparticles with arbitrary crystal structures and
		to calculate the associated pair-distribution function and
		X-ray/neutron total-scattering signals. It also provides a
		target function that can be used for simultaneous fitting of
		small- and wide-angle total scattering data in real and
		reciprocal spaces. The target function can be generated either
		as a sum of weighted residuals for individual datasets or as a
		vector of residuals suitable for optimization using multi-
		criteria algorithms (e.g. Pareto methods).
