		Dynamic Path Approach // A GUI or command-line operated data
		analysis tool, for analyzing time-dependent simulation data in
		which multiple instantaneous or time-lagged relations are
		assumed. This package uses Structural Equation Modeling (the
		sem package). It is aimed to deal with time-dependent data and
		estimate whether a causal diagram fits data from an (agent-
		based) simulation model.
