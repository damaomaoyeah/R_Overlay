		LOGICOIL: multi-state prediction of coiled-coil oligomeric state.
		// This package contains the functions necessary to run the
		LOGICOIL algorithm. LOGICOIL can be used to differentiate
		between antiparallel dimers, parallel dimers, trimers and
		higher-order coiled-coil sequence. By covering 90 percent of
		the known coiled-coil structures, LOGICOIL is a net improvement
		compared with other existing methods, which achieve a
		predictive coverage of around 31 percent of this population. As
		such, LOGICOIL is particularly useful for researchers looking
		to characterize novel coiled-coil sequences or studying coiled-
		coil containing protein assemblies. It may also be used to
		assist in the structural characterization of synthetic coiled-
		coil sequences.
