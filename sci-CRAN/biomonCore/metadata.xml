		Controller Layer for Biomon App Data Analysis // Biomon app is a
		software for data analysis automation in Biomonitoring. The
		implementation is split in three packages taking into account
		the development model Models-Views-Controllers. Each of these
		layers supported by a different package: The package Analyz
		concerns the Models layer of Biomon app; BiomonCore concerns
		the Controllers layer and Biomon concerns the Views layer.
		BiomonCore delivers two classes, the class Global prepares the
		global environment for Biomon app execution and the class
		Action that delivers methods to deal with the user's requests
		from the interface, the View layer, and forward them to the
		methods defined in the Model layer.
