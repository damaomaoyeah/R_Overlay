		A Genetic Algorithm for Fixed-Size Subset Selection // Function
		kofnGA uses a genetic algorithm to choose a subset of a fixed
		size k from the integers 1:n, such that a user-supplied
		objective function is minimized at that subset.  The selection
		step is done by tournament selection based on ranks, and
		elitism may be used to retain a portion of the best solutions
		from one generation to the next.
