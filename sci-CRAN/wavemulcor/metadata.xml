		Wavelet routine for multiple correlation // Wavelet routines that
		calculate single sets of wavelet multiple correlations and
		cross-correlations out of n variables (either 1D time series,
		2D images or 3D arrays). They can later be plotted in single
		graphs, as an alternative to trying to make sense out of
		several sets of wavelet correlations or wavelet cross-
		correlations. The code is based on the calculation, at each
		wavelet scale, of the square root of the coefficient of
		determination in a linear combination of variables for which
		such coefficient of determination is a maximum. The code
		provided here is based on the wave.correlation routine in
		Brandon Whitcher's waveslim R package Version: 1.6.4, which in
		turn is based on wavelet methodology developed in Percival and
		Walden (2000); Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001) and others.
