		Flexible Cluster Algorithms // The main function kcca implements
		a general framework for k-centroids cluster analysis supporting
		arbitrary distance measures and centroid computation. Further
		cluster methods include hard competitive learning, neural gas,
		and QT clustering. There are numerous visualization methods for
		cluster results (neighborhood graphs, convex cluster hulls,
		barcharts of centroids, ...), and bootstrap methods for the
		analysis of cluster stability.
