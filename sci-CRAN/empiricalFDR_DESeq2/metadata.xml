		Simulation-Based False Discovery Rate in RNA-Seq // Auxiliary
		functions for the DESeq2 package to simulate read counts
		according to the null hypothesis (i.e., with empirical sample
		size factors, per-gene total counts and dispersions, but
		without effects of predictor variables) and to compute the
		empirical false discovery rate.
