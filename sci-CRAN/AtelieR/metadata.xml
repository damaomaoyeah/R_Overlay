		A GTK GUI for teaching basic concepts in statistical inference,
		and doing elementary bayesian tests. // A collection of
		statistical simulation and computation tools with a GTK GUI, to
		help teach statistical concepts and compute probabilities. Two
		domains are covered: I. Understanding (Central-Limit Theorem
		and the Normal Distribution, Distribution of a sample mean,
		Distribution of a sample variance, Probability calculator for
		common distributions), and II. Elementary Bayesian Statistics
		(bayesian inference on proportions, contingency tables, means
		and variances, with informative and noninformative priors).
