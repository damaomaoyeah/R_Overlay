		Simulations to predict the number of loci expected in RAD and GBS
		approaches. // This package provides a number of functions to
		simulate restriction enzyme digestion, library construction and
		fragments size selection to predict the number of loci expected
		from most of the Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) and
		Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) approaches. SimRAD aims is to
		provide an estimation of the number of loci expected from a
		particular genome depending on the protocol type and parameters
		allowing to assess feasibility, multiplexing capacity and the
		amount of sequencing required.
