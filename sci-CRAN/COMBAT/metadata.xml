		To compute gene-based genetic association statistics from P
		values at multiple SNPs and genotype data of ancestry matched
		reference samples. COMBined Association Test (COMBAT)
		incorporates strengths from multiple existing gene-based tests,
		including VEGAS, GATES and SimpleM, and achieves much improved
		performance than any individual test.
