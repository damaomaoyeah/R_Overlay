		Robust Periodogram and Periodicity Detection Methods //
		Calculates periodograms based on (robustly) fitting periodic
		functions to light curves (irregularly observed time series,
		possibly with measurement accuracies, occurring in
		astroparticle physics). Three main functions are included:
		RobPer calculates the periodogram. Outlying periodogram bars
		(indicating a period) can be detected with betaCvMfit.
		Artificial light curves can be generated using the function
		tsgen. For more details see Thieler, Fried and Rathjens (2013).
