		R Client for the Lagotto Altmetrics Platform // An R interface to
		the open source article level metrics platform
		https://github.com/articlemetrics/lagotto/ created by the
		Public Library of Science (PLOS). A number of publishers are
		using the open source app created by PLOS, so you can drop in a
		different base URL to the functions in this package to get to
		not only PLOS data, but data for Crossref, and more as the open
		source PLOS software is used.
