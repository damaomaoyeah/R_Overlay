		Gaussian Mixture Modeling Algorithms and the Belief-Based Mixture
		Modeling // Two partially supervised mixture modeling methods:
		soft-label and belief-based modeling are implemented. For
		completeness, we equipped the package also with the
		functionality of unsupervised, semi- and fully supervised
		mixture modeling.  The package can be applied also to selection
		of the best-fitting from a set of models with different
		component numbers or constraints on their structures. For
		detailed introduction see: Przemyslaw Biecek, Ewa Szczurek,
		Martin Vingron, Jerzy Tiuryn (2012), The R Package bgmm:
		Mixture Modeling with Uncertain Knowledge, Journal of
		Statistical Software doi:10.18637/jss.v047.i03.
