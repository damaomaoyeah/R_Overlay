		Stacks, Queues, and 'Deques' for R // Queues, stacks, and
		'deques' are list-like, abstract data types. These are meant to
		be very cheap to "grow", or insert new objects into. A typical
		use case involves storing data in a list in a streaming
		fashion, when you do not necessarily know how may elements need
		to be stored. Unlike R's lists, the new data structures
		provided here are not necessarily stored contiguously, making
		insertions and deletions at the front/end of the structure much
		faster.  The underlying implementation is new and uses a
		head/tail doubly linked list; thus, we do not rely on R's
		environments or hashing.  To avoid unnecessary data copying,
		most operations on these data structures are performed via
		side-effects.
