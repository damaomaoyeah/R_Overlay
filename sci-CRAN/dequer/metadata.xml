		An R 'Deque' Container // Offers a special data structure called
		a 'deque' (pronounced like 'deck'), which is a list-like
		structure.  However, unlike R's list structure, data put into a
		'deque' is not necessarily stored contiguously, making
		insertions and deletions at the front/end of the structure much
		faster.  The implementation here is new and uses a doubly
		linked list, and whence does not rely on R's environments.  To
		avoid unnecessary data copying, most 'deque' operations are
		performed via side-effects.
