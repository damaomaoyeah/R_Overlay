		Query Cache for HTTP Clients // In order to improve performance
		for HTTP API clients, 'httpcache' provides simple tools for
		caching and invalidating cache. It includes the HTTP verb
		functions GET, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE, which are drop-in
		replacements for those in the 'httr' package. These functions
		are cache-aware and provide default settings for cache
		invalidation suitable for RESTful APIs; the package also
		enables custom cache-management strategies. Finally,
		'httpcache' includes a basic logging framework to facilitate
		the measurement of HTTP request time and cache performance.
