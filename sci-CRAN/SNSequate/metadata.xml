		Standard and Nonstandard Statistical Models and Methods for Test
		Equating // The package contains functions to perform various
		models and methods for test equating. It currently implements
		the traditional mean, linear and equipercentile equating
		methods, as well as the mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara and
		Stocking-Lord IRT linking methods. It also supports newest
		methods such that local equating, kernel equating (using
		Gaussian, logistic and uniform kernels), and IRT parameter
		linking methods based on asymmetric item characteristic
		functions. Functions to obtain both standard error of equating
		(SEE) and standard error of equating difference between two
		equating functions (SEED) are also implemented for the kernel
		method of equating.
