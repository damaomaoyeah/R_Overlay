		Statistical Methods for the (Regional) Analysis of Flood
		Frequency // Includes several statistical methods for the
		estimation of parameters and high quantiles of river flow
		distributions. The focus is on regional estimation based on
		homogeneity assumptions and computed from multivariate
		observations (multiple measurement stations). For details see
		Kinsvater et al. (2017) arXiv:1701.06455.
