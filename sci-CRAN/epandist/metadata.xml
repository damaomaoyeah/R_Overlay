		Statistical Functions for the Censored and Uncensored
		Epanechnikov Distribution // Analyzing censored variables
		usually requires the use of optimization algorithms. This
		package provides an alternative algebraic approach to the task
		of determining the expected value of a random censored variable
		with a known censoring point. Likewise this approach allows for
		the determination of the censoring point if the expected value
		is known. These results are derived under the assumption that
		the variable follows an Epanechnikov kernel distribution with
		known mean and range prior to censoring. Statistical functions
		related to the uncensored Epanechnikov distribution are also
		provided by this package.
