		Global-Value-Chain Decomposition // Two global-value-chain
		decompositions are implemented. Firstly, the Wang-Wei-Zhu
		(Wang, Wei, and Zhu, 2013) algorithm splits bilateral gross
		exports into 16 value-added components. Secondly, the Leontief
		decomposition (default) derives the value added origin of
		exports by country and industry, which is also based on Wang,
		Wei, and Zhu (Wang, Z., S.-J. Wei, and K. Zhu. 2013.
		"Quantifying International Production Sharing at the Bilateral
		and Sector Levels.").
