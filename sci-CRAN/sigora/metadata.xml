		SIGNATURE OVERREPRESENTATION ANALYSIS // SIGORA is a Pathway
		Analysis package. Pathway Analysis is the process of
		statistically linking observations on the molecular level to
		biological processes or pathways on the systems (cell, tissue,
		organ, organism) level. Traditional pathway analysis methods
		regard pathways as collections of single genes and treat all
		genes in a pathway as equally informative. This can lead to
		identification of spurious/misleading pathways as statistically
		significant, since many components are shared amongst pathways.
		SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by focusing on genes or
		gene-pairs that are (as a combination) specific to a single
		pathway. In relying on such pathway gene-pair signatures
		(Pathway-GPSs), SIGORA inherently uses the status of other
		genes in the experimental context to identify the most relevant
		pathways. The current version allows for pathway analysis of
		human and mouse data sets and contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS
		data for pathways in the KEGG, PID_BIOCARTA, PID_NCI, INOH and
		REACTOME pathway repositories. For more information, please see
		our manuscript submitted to Bioinformatics, 2012.
