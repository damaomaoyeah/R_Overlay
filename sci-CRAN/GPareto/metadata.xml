		Gaussian Processes for Pareto Front Estimation and Optimization
		// Gaussian process regression models, a.k.a. kriging models,
		are applied to global multiobjective optimization of black-box
		functions. Multiobjective Expected Improvement and Step-wise
		Uncertainty Reduction sequential infill criteria are available.
		A quantification of uncertainty on Pareto fronts is provided
		using conditional simulations.
