		Power and Sample Size Based on Two One-Sided t-Tests (TOST) for
		(Bio)Equivalence Studies // Contains functions to calculate
		power and sample size for various study designs used for
		bioequivalence studies. See function known.designs() for study
		designs covered. Moreover the package contains functions for
		power and sample size based on 'expected' power in case of
		uncertain (estimated) variability. ----- Added are functions
		for the power and sample size for the ratio of two means with
		normally distributed data on the original scale (based on
		Fieller's confidence ('fiducial') interval). ----- Contains
		further functions for power and sample size calculations based
		on non-inferiority t-test. This is not a TOST procedure but
		eventually useful if the question of 'non-superiority' must be
		evaluated. The power and sample size calculations based on non-
		inferiority test may also performed via 'expected' power in
		case of uncertain (estimated) variability. ----- Contains
		functions power.scABEL() and sampleN.scABEL() to calculate
		power and sample size for the BE decision via scaled (widened)
		BE acceptance limits based on simulations. Contains further
		functions power.RSABE() and sampleN.RSABE() to calculate power
		and sample size for the BE decision via reference scaled ABE
		criterion according to the FDA procedure based on simulations.
		Contains further functions power.NTIDFDA() and
		sampleN.NTIDFDA() to calculate power and sample size for the BE
		decision via the FDA procedure for NTID's based on simulations.
		----- Contains functions for power analysis of a sample size
		plan for ABE (pa.ABE()), scaled ABE (pa.scABE()) and scaled ABE
		for NTID's (pa.NTIDFDA()) analysing power if deviating from
		assumptions of the plan. ----- Contains further functions for
		power calculations / samplesize estimation for dose
		proportionality studies using the Power model.
