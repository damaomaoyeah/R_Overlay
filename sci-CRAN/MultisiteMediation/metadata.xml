		Causal Mediation Analysis in Multisite Trials // We implement
		multisite causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed
		by Qin and Hong (in press). It enables causal mediation
		analysis in multisite trials, in which individuals are assigned
		to a treatment or a control group at each site. It allows for
		estimation and hypothesis testing for not only the population
		average but also the between-site variance of direct and
		indirect effects. This strategy conveniently relaxes the
		assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction while
		greatly simplifying the outcome model specification without
		invoking strong distributional assumptions.
