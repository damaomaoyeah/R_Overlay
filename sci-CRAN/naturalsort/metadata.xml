		Natural Ordering // The package provides functions related to
		human natural ordering. It handles adjacent digits in a
		character sequence as a number so that natural sort function
		arranges a character vector by their numbers, not digit
		characters. It is typically seen when operating systems lists
		file names. For example, a sequence a-1.png, a-2.png, a-10.png
		looks naturally ordered because 1  2  10 and natural sort
		algorithm arranges so whereas general sort algorithms arrange
		it into a-1.png, a-10.png, a-2.png owing to their third and
		fourth characters.
