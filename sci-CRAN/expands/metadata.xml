		ExPANdS // Expanding Ploidy and Allele Frequency on Nested
		Subpopulations (ExPANdS) characterizes coexisting
		subpopulations in a tumor using copy number and allele
		frequencies derived from exome- or whole genome sequencing
		input data (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24177718). The
		model amplifies the statistical power to detect coexisting
		genotypes, by exploiting run-specific tradeoffs between depth
		of coverage and breadth of coverage. ExPANdS predicts the
		number of clonal expansions, the size of the resulting
		subpopulations in the tumor bulk, the mutations specific to
		each subpopulation and tumor purity. The main function
		runExPANdS provides the complete functionality needed to
		predict coexisting subpopulations from single nucleotide
		variations (SNVs) and associated copy numbers.  The robustness
		of the subpopulation predictions by ExPANdS increases with the
		number of mutations provided. It is recommended that at least
		200 mutations are used as an input to obtain stable results.
		Updates include: (1) Additional optional parameter
		"min_CellFreq" provided for function runExPANdS, specifying the
		minimum cellular prevalence of mutations to be included for
		subpopulation predictions.(2) Filtered loci with high-level
		amplifications, according to max_PM setting. This reduces
		unnecessary processing time, as assignment of mutations within
		amplified regions to subpopulations is not successful. (3)
		Additional function "buildMultiSamplePhylo" available, which
		integrates the subpopulations predicted in multiple,
		geographically distinct tumor samples into one common
		phylogeny.
