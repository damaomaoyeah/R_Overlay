		General-Purpose Unconstrained Non-Linear Optimization // An
		algorithm for general-purpose unconstrained non-linear
		optimization. The algorithm is of quasi-Newton type with BFGS
		updating of the inverse Hessian and soft line search with a
		trust region type monitoring of the input to the line search
		algorithm. The interface of 'ucminf' is designed for easy
		interchange with 'optim'.
