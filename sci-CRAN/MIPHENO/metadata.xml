		Mutant Identification through Probabilistic High throughput
		Enabled NOrmalization // This package contains functions to
		carry out processing of high throughput data analysis and
		detection of putative hits/mutants.  Contents include a
		function for post-hoc quality control for removal of outlier
		sample sets, a median-based normalization method for use in
		datasets where there are no explicit controls and where most of
		the responses are of the wildtype/no response class (see
		accompanying paper).  The package also includes a way to
		prioritize individuals of interest using am empirical
		cumulative distribution function. Methods for generating
		synthetic data as well as data from the Chloroplast 2010
		project are included.
