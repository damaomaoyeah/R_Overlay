		Calibrated Machine Learning // The package "camel" provides the
		implementation of a family of high-dimensional calibrated
		machine learning tools, including (1) LAD, SQRT Lasso and
		Calibrated Dantzig Selector for estimating sparse linear
		models; (2) Calibrated Multivariate Regression for estimating
		sparse multivariate linear models; (3) Tiger, Calibrated Clime
		for estimating sparse Gaussian graphical models. We adopt the
		combination of the dual smoothing and monotone fast iterative
		soft-thresholding algorithm (MFISTA). The computation is
		memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output, and
		accelerated by the path following and active set tricks.
