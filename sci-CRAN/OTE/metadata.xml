		Optimal Trees Ensembles for Regression, Classification and Class
		Membership Probability Estimation // Functions for creating
		ensembles of optimal trees for regression, classification and
		class membership probability estimation are given. A few trees
		are selected from an initial set of trees grown by random
		forest for the ensemble on the basis of their individual and
		collective performance. Trees are assessed on out-of-bag data
		and on an independent training data set for individual and
		collective performance respectively. The prediction functions
		return estimates of the test responses and their class
		membership probabilities. Unexplained variations, error rates,
		confusion matrix, Brier scores, etc. are also returned for the
		test data.
