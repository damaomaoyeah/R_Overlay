		Software Tools to Quantify Structural Importance of Nodes in a
		Network // Provides functionality to compute various node
		centrality measures on networks. Included are functions to
		compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and
		Bader's SNAP library), implementations of Burt's constraint and
		effective network size (ENS) metrics, Borgatti's algorithm to
		identify key players, and Valente's bridging metric. On Unix
		systems, the betweenness, Key Players, and bridging
		implementations are parallelized with OpenMP, which may run
		faster on systems which have OpenMP configured.
