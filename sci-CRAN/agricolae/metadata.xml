		Statistical Procedures for Agricultural Research // Original idea
		was presented in the thesis "A statistical analysis tool for
		agricultural research" to obtain the degree of Master on
		science, National Engineering University (UNI), Lima-Peru. Some
		experimental data for the examples come from the CIP and others
		research. Agricolae offers extensive functionality on
		experimental design especially for agricultural and plant
		breeding experiments, which can also be useful for other
		purposes. It supports planning of lattice, Alpha, Cyclic,
		Complete Block, Latin Square, Graeco-Latin Squares, augmented
		block, factorial, split and strip plot designs. There are also
		various analysis facilities for experimental data, e.g.
		treatment comparison procedures and several non-parametric
		tests comparison, biodiversity indexes and consensus cluster.
