		Statistical Procedures for Agricultural Research // Agricolae was
		presented in the thesis "A statistical analysis tool for
		agricultural research" to obtain the degree of Master on
		science, mention Systems Engineering, Faculty of Industrial and
		Systems Engineering, National Engineering University (UNI),
		Lima-Peru. Original idea, support and data sets came from CIP
		(International Potato Center). Agricolae offers extensive
		functionality on experimental design especially for
		agricultural and plant breeding experiments, which can also be
		useful for other purposes. It supports planning of lattice,
		Alpha, Cyclic, Complete Block, Latin Square, Graeco-Latin
		Squares, augmented block, factorial, split and strip plot
		designs. There are also various analysis facilities for
