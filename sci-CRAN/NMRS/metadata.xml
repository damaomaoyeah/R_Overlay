		NMR Spectroscopy // NMRS has been developed to load directly the
		spectra in the Bruker spectroscopy format. This application
		displays the spectrum reference and manages basic operations
		such as setting the chemical shift of a certain compound (TSP
		or DSS) to 0 ppm,zero order and first order phase corrections,
		baseline adjustment and spectral area selection
