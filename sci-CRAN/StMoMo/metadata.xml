		Stochastic Mortality Modelling // Implementation of the family of
		generalised age-period-cohort stochastic mortality models. This
		family of models encompasses many models proposed in the
		actuarial and demographic literature including the Lee-Carter
		(1992) doi:10.2307/2290201 and the Cairns-Blake-Dowd (2006)
		doi:10.1111/j.1539-6975.2006.00195.x models. It includes
		functions for fitting mortality models, analysing their
		goodness-of-fit and performing mortality projections and
		simulations.
