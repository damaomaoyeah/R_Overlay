		Stochastic Mortality Modelling // Implementation of the family of
		generalised age-period-cohort stochastic mortality models.
		This family of models encompasses many models proposed in the
		actuarial and demographic literature including the Lee-Carter
		model and the Cairns-Blake-Dowd model. It includes functions
		for fitting mortality models, analysing their goodness-of-fit
		and performing mortality projections and simulations.
