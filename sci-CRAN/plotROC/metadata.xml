		Generate Useful ROC Curve Charts for Print and Interactive Use //
		Most ROC curve plots obscure the cutoff values and inhibit
		interpretation and comparison of multiple curves. This attempts
		to address those shortcomings by providing plotting and
		interactive tools. Functions are provided to generate an
		interactive ROC curve plot for web use, and print versions. A
		Shiny application implementing the functions is also included.
