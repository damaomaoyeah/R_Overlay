		Simulating Data to Study Performance of Clustering Algorithms //
		The utility of this package is in simulating mixtures of
		Gaussian distributions with different levels of overlap between
		mixture components.  Pairwise overlap, defined as a sum of two
		misclassification probabilities, measures the degree of
		interaction between components and can be readily employed to
		control the clustering complexity of datasets simulated from
		mixtures. These datasets can then be used for systematic
		performance investigation of clustering and finite mixture
		modeling algorithms. Among other capabilities of 'MixSim',
		there are computing the exact overlap for Gaussian mixtures,
		simulating Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, simulating outliers
		and noise variables, calculating various measures of agreement
		between two partitionings, and constructing parallel
		distribution plots for the graphical display of finite mixture
		models.
