		Tools for the provision of scientific fisheries management advice
		// The tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organisations
		(tRFMOs) use a common framework for providing scientific
		advice, i.e. the Kobe II Framework. This is based on
		maintaining fishing mortality below FMSY and stock biomass
		above  BMSY. This package provides methods for summarising
		results from stock assessments and Management Strategy
		Evaluations in the Kobe format.
