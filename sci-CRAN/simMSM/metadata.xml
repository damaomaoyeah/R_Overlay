		Simulation of Event Histories for Multi-State Models //
		Simulation of event histories with possibly non-linear baseline
		hazard rate functions, non-linear (time-varying) covariate
		effect functions, and dependencies on the past of the history.
		Random generation of event histories is performed using
		inversion sampling on the cumulative all-cause hazard rate
		functions.
