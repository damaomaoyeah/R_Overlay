		An Implementation of the Grammar of Graphics // An implementation
		of the grammar of graphics in R. It combines the advantages of
		both base and lattice graphics: conditioning and shared axes
		are handled automatically, and you can still build up a plot
		step by step from multiple data sources. It also implements a
		sophisticated multidimensional conditioning system and a
		consistent interface to map data to aesthetic attributes. See
		http://ggplot2.org for more information, documentation and
		examples.
