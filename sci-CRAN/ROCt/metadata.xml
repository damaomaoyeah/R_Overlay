		Time-dependent ROC curve estimation and adaptation to the
		relative survival context // This package contains functions in
		order to estimate time-dependent ROC with right-censored data.
		More precisely, two functions concern the estimation of ROC
		curves defined by Heagerty, Lumley and Pepe (Biometrics, 2000).
		The two other functions concern their adaptation for studying
		the capacity of a marker to predict the excess of mortality of
		a specific population compared to the general population (same
		age, gender and calendar year). This last part is based on
		additive relative survival models and the work of Pohar-Perme
		(Biometrics, 2011).
