		Time-Dependent ROC Curve Estimators and Expected Utility
		Functions // Contains functions in order to estimate diagnostic
		and prognostic capacities of continuous markers. More
		precisely, one function concerns the estimation of time-
		dependent ROC (ROCt) curve, as proposed by Heagerty et al.
		(2000) doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2000.00337.x. One function
		concerns the adaptation of the ROCt theory for studying the
		capacity of a marker to predict the excess of mortality of a
		specific population compared to the general population. This
		last part is based on additive relative survival models and the
		work of Pohar-Perme et al. (2012)
		doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2011.01640.x. We also propose two
		functions for cut-off estimation in medical decision making by
		maximizing time-dependent expected utility function. Finally,
		we propose confounder-adjusted estimators of ROC and ROCt
		curves by using the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)
		approach.  For the confounder-adjusted ROC curve (without
		censoring), we also proposed the implementation of the
		estimator based on placement values proposed by Pepe and Cai
		(2004) doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00200.x.
