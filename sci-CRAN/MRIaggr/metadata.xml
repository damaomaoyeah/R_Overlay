		Management, Display, and Processing of Medical Imaging Data //
		Provide a compact storage for medical imaging data with access
		and display possibilities. Basic tools for processing brain
		imaging data are proposed like extraction of brain voxels,
		morphological image segmentation, and filtering / normalization
		of contrast parameters. Specific tools are also provided for
		blood perfusion imaging to calculate hypoperfusion and
		reperfusion volumes.
