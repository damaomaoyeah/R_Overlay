		Spatially explicit population genetic simulations // This package
		creates a individual-based population genetic simulation.
		Individuals have spatial coordinates, dispersal governed by
		mixtures of Weibull and normal pdfs.  It is discrete-time.  It
		can be arbitrarily complex given enough known or assumed
		demographic characteristics.  Simulates diploid and haploid
		inheritance. Allows the development of null distributions of
		genotypes for complex demographic scenarios.  This version
		includes some approximations for pollen (male gamete)
		dispersal.
