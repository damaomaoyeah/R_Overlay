		Optimal and Fast Univariate k-Means Clustering // A dynamic
		programming algorithm for optimal univariate k-means
		clustering. Minimizing the sum of squares of within-cluster
		distances, the algorithm guarantees optimality and
		reproducibility. Its advantage over heuristic k-means
		algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is increasingly
		pronounced as the number of clusters k increases. It provides
		an alternative to heuristic k-means algorithms for univariate
		clustering.
