		Optimal and Fast Univariate k-Means Clustering // A dynamic
		programming algorithm for optimal one-dimensional k-means
		clustering. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of
		within-cluster distances. As an alternative to heuristic
		k-means algorithms, this method guarantees optimality and
		reproducibility. Its advantage in efficiency and accuracy over
		k-means is increasingly pronounced as the number of clusters k
		increases.
