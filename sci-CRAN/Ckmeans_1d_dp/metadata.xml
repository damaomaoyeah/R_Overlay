		Optimal and Fast Univariate k-Means Clustering // A dynamic
		programming algorithm for optimal univariate k-means
		clustering. Minimizing the sum of squares of within-cluster
		distances, the algorithm guarantees optimality and
		reproducibility. Its advantage over heuristic clustering
		algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is increasingly
		pronounced as the number of clusters k increases. With optional
		weights, the algorithm can also analyze 1-D signals for
		segmentation and peak calling. An auxiliary function can
		generate adaptive histograms to make patterns in data stand
		out. For univariate data analysis, the package provides a
		powerful alternative to heuristic clustering algorithms.
