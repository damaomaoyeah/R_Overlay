		Optimal and Fast Univariate Clustering // A fast dynamic
		programming algorithm for optimal univariate clustering.
		Minimizing the sum of squares of within-cluster distances, the
		algorithm guarantees optimality and reproducibility. Its
		advantage over heuristic clustering algorithms in efficiency
		and accuracy is increasingly pronounced as the number of
		clusters k increases. With optional weights, the algorithm can
		also optimally segment time series and perform peak calling. An
		auxiliary function generates histograms that are adaptive to
		patterns in data. This package provides a powerful alternative
		to heuristic methods for univariate data analysis.
