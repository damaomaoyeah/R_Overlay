		Optimal and Fast Univariate k-Means Clustering // A fast dynamic
		programming algorithm for optimal univariate k-means
		clustering. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of
		within-cluster distances. As an alternative to heuristic
		k-means algorithms, this method guarantees optimality and
		reproducibility. Its advantage in efficiency and accuracy over
		heuristic k-means clustering is increasingly pronounced as the
		number of clusters k increases.
