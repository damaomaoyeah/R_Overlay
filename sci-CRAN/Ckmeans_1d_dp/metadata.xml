		Optimal k-Means Clustering for One-Dimensional Data // A dynamic
		programming algorithm for optimal one-dimensional k-means
		clustering. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of
		within-cluster distances. As an alternative to the standard
		heuristic k-means algorithm, this algorithm guarantees
		optimality and repeatability.
