		Generalized Archimedean Copula // Bi-variate data fitting is done
		by two stochastic components: the marginal distributions and
		the dependency structure. The dependency structure is modeled
		through a copula. An algorithm was implemented considering
		seven families of copulas (Generalized Archimedean Copulas),
		the best fitting can be obtained looking all copula's options
		(totally positive of order 2 and stochastically increasing
		models).
