		Partitioned Distance Function // Computes the euclidean distance
		between rows of a matrix X and rows of another matrix Y.
		Previously, this could be done by binding the two matrices
		together and calling 'dist', but this creates unnecessary
		computation by computing the distances between a row of X and
		another row of X, and likewise for Y. pdist strictly computes
		distances across the two matrices, not within the same matrix,
		making computations significantly faster for certain use cases.
