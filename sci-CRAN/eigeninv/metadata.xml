		Generates (dense) matrices that have a given set of eigenvalues
		// Solves the ``inverse eigenvalue problem'' which is to
		generate a real-valued matrix that has the specified real
		eigenvalue spectrum.  It can generate infinitely many dense
		matrices, symmetric or asymmetric, with the given set of
		eigenvalues.  Algorithm can also generate stochastic and doubly
		stochastic matrices.
