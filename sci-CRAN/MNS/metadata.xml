		Mixed Neighbourhood Selection // An implementation of the mixed
		neighbourhood selection (MNS) algorithm. The MNS algorithm can
		be used to estimate multiple related precision matrices. In
		particular, the motivation behind this work was driven by the
		need to understand functional connectivity networks across
		multiple subjects. This package also contains an implementation
		of a novel algorithm through which to simulate multiple related
		precision matrices which exhibit properties frequently reported
		in neuroimaging analysis.
