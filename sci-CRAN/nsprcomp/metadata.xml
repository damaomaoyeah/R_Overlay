		Non-Negative and Sparse PCA // This package implements two
		methods for performing a constrained principal component
		analysis (PCA), where non-negativity and/or sparsity
		constraints are enforced on the principal axes (PAs). The
		function 'nsprcomp' computes one principal component (PC) after
		the other. Each PA is optimized such that the corresponding PC
		has maximum additional variance not explained by the previous
		components. In contrast, the function 'nscumcomp' jointly
		computes all PCs such that the cumulative variance is maximal.
		Both functions have the same interface as the 'prcomp' function
		from the 'stats' package (plus some extra parameters), and both
		return the result of the analysis as an object of class
		'nsprcomp', which inherits from 'prcomp'.
