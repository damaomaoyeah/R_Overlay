		Inhomogeneous Self-Exciting Process // Simulate an inhomogeneous
		self-exciting process (IHSEP), or Hawkes process, with a given
		(time-varying) baseline intensity and an excitation function.
		Calculate the likelihood of an IHSEP with given baseline
		intensity and excitation functions for an (increasing) sequence
		of event times. Calculate the point process residuals (integral
		transforms of the original event times). Calculate the mean
		intensity process.
