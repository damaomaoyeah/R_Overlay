		Diagnostic accuracy of classification models. // Several
		functions for evaluating the accuracy of classification models.
		The package provides the following performance measures:
		repeated k-fold cross-validation, 0.632 and 0.632+ bootstrap
		estimation of the misclassification rate, sensitivity,
		specificity and AUC. If an application is computationally
		intensive, parallel execution can be used to reduce the
		computational effort.
