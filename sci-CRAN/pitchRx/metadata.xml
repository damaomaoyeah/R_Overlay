		Tools for Harnessing MLBAM Gameday Data and Visualizing PITCHf/x
		// With pitchRx, one can easily obtain Major League Baseball
		Advanced Media's Gameday data (as well as store it in a remote
		database). The Gameday website hosts a wealth of data in XML
		format, but perhaps most interesting is PITCHf/x. Among other
		things, PITCHf/x data can be used to recreate a baseball's
		flight path from a pitcher's hand to home plate. With pitchRx,
		one can easily create animations and interactive 3D
		scatterplots of the baseball's flight path. PITCHf/x data is
		also commonly used to generate a static plot of baseball
		locations at the moment they cross home plate. These plots,
		sometimes called strike-zone plots, can also refer to a plot of
		event probabilities over the same region. pitchRx provides an
		easy and robust way to generate strike-zone plots using the
		ggplot2 package.
