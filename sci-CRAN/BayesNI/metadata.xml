		BayesNI: Bayesian Testing Procedure for Noninferiority with
		Binary Endpoints // A Bayesian testing procedure for
		noninferiority trials with binary endpoints. The prior is
		constructed based on Bernstein polynomials with options for
		both informative and non-informative prior. The critical value
		of the test statistic (Bayes factor) is determined by
		minimizing total weighted error (TWE) criteria
