		Multi-Label Prediction Using Gibbs Sampling (and Classifier
		Chains) // An implementation of classifier chains (CC's) for
		multi-label prediction. Users can employ an external package
		(e.g. 'randomForest', 'C50'), or supply their own. The package
		can train a single set of CC's or train an ensemble of CC's --
		in parallel if running in a multi-core environment. New
		observations are classified using a Gibbs sampler since each
		unobserved label is conditioned on the others. The package
		includes methods for evaluating the predictions for accuracy
		and aggregating across iterations and models to produce binary
		or probabilistic classifications.
