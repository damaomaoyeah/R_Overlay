		Stochastic Augmentation of Matched Data Using Restriction Methods
		// Augmenting a matched data set by generating multiple
		stochastic, matched samples from the data using a multi-
		dimensional histogram constructed from dropping the input
		matched data into a multi-dimensional grid built on the full
		data set. The resulting stochastic, matched sets will likely
		provide a collectively higher coverage of the full data set
		compared to the single matched set. Each stochastic match is
		without duplication, thus allowing downstream validation
		techniques such as cross-validation to be applied to each set
		without concern for overfitting.
