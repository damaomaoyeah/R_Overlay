		Recursive Partitioning for Structural Equation Models // SEM
		Trees and SEM Forests -- an extension of model-based decision
		trees and forests to Structural Equation Models (SEM). SEM
		trees hierarchically split empirical data into homogeneous
		groups sharing similar data patterns with respect to a SEM by
		recursively selecting optimal predictors of these differences.
		SEM forests are an extension of SEM trees. They are ensembles
		of SEM trees each built on a random sample of the original
		data. By aggregating over a forest, we obtain measures of
		variable importance that are more robust than measures from
		single trees.
