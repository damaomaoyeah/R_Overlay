		Random Generation of Contingency Tables // Contains functions for
		random generation of R x C and 2 x 2 x K contingency tables. In
		addition to the generation of contingency tables over
		predetermined intraclass-correlated clusters, it is possible to
		generate contingency tables without intraclass correlations
		under product multinomial, multinomial, and Poisson sampling
		plans. It also consists of a function for generation of random
		data from a given discrete probability distribution function.
