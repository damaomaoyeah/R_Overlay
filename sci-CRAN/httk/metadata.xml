		High-Throughput Toxicokinetics // Functions and data tables for
		simulation and statistical analysis of chemical toxicokinetics
		("TK") using data obtained from relatively high throughput, in
		vitro studies. Both physiologically-based ("PBTK") and
		empirical (e.g., one compartment) "TK" models can be
		parameterized for several hundred chemicals and multiple
		species. These models are solved efficiently, often using
		compiled (C-based) code. A Monte Carlo sampler is included for
		simulating biological variability and measurement limitations.
		Functions are also provided for exporting "PBTK" models to
		"SBML" and "JARNAC" for use with other simulation software.
		These functions and data provide a set of tools for in vitro-in
		vivo extrapolation ("IVIVE") of high throughput screening data
		(e.g., ToxCast) to real-world exposures via reverse dosimetry
		(also known as "RTK").
