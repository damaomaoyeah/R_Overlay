		Inferences for ratios of coefficients in the general linear model
		// With this package, it is possible to perform (simultaneous)
		inferences for ratios of linear combinations of coefficients in
		the general linear model. In particular, tests and confidence
		interval estimations for ratios of treatment means in the
		normal one-way layout and confidence interval estimations like
		in (multiple) slope ratio and parallel line assays can be
		carried out. Moreover, it is possible to calculate the sample
		sizes required in comparisons with a control based on relative
		margins. For the simple two-sample problem, functions for a
		t-test for ratio-formatted hypotheses and the corresponding
		Fieller-type confidence interval are provided assuming
		homogeneous or heterogeneous group variances.
