		Default Color Maps from 'matplotlib' // Port of the new
		'matplotlib' color maps ('viridis' - the default -, 'magma',
		'plasma' and 'inferno') to 'R'. 'matplotlib'
		http://matplotlib.org/  is a popular plotting library for
		'python'. These color maps are designed in such a way that they
		will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in
		regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. They
		are also designed to be perceived by readers with the most
		common form of color blindness.
