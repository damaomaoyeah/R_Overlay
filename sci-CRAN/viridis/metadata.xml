		Matplotlib Default Color Map // Port of the new Matplotlib
		default color map ('viridis') to R. This color map is designed
		in such a way that it will analytically be perfectly
		perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when
		converted to black-and-white. It is also designed to be
		perceived by readers with the most common form of color
		blindness.
