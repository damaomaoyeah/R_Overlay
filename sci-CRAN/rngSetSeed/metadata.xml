		Seeding the Default RNG with a Numeric Vector // A function
		setVectorSeed() is provided. Its argument is a numeric vector
		of an arbitrary nonzero length, whose components have integer
		values from [0, 2^32-1]. The input vector is transformed using
		AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm into an initial
		state of Mersenne-Twister random number generator. The function
		provides a better alternative to the R base function
		set.seed(), if the input vector is a single integer.
		Initializing a stream of random numbers with a vector is a
		convenient way to obtain several streams, each of which is
		identified by several integer indices.
