		Co-correspondence Analysis Methods // Fits predictive and
		symmetric co-correspondence analysis (CoCA) models to relate
		one data matrix to another data matrix. More specifically, CoCA
		maximises the weighted covariance between the weighted averaged
		species scores of one community and the weighted averaged
		species scores of another community. CoCA attempts to find
		patterns that are common to both communities.
