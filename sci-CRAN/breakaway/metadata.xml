		Species richness estimation and modelling // breakaway estimates
		and models total (observed plus unobserved) species richness.
		It is applicable to any situation where an unknown number of
		classes is to be estimated, but is especially suited to the
		microbial context. Microbial diversity datasets are
		characterized by a large number of rare species and a small
		number of highly abundant species. The class of models
		implemented by breakaway is flexible enough to model both these
		features. In the event that the practitioner does not believe
		or trust their singleton count, the procedure breakaway_nof1
		estimates diversity in a way that does not require a singleton
		count. betta_basic runs a regression-type analysis of estimated
		total diversity, thus permitting accounting for unobserved taxa
		while also incorporating available covariate information.
		betta_basic does not enforce use of breakaway for diversity
		estimation.
