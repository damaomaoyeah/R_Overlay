		Phase Plane Analysis of One and Two Dimensional Autonomous ODE
		Systems // phaseR is an R package for the qualitative analysis
		of one and two dimensional autonomous ODE systems, using phase
		plane methods. Programs are available to identify and classify
		equilibrium points, plot the direction field, and plot
		trajectories for multiple initial conditions. In the one
		dimensional case, a program is also available to plot the phase
		portrait. Whilst in the two dimensional case, additionally a
		program is available to plot nullclines. Many example systems
		are provided for the user.
