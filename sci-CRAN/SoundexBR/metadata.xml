		Phonetic-Coding For Portuguese // The SoundexBR package provides
		an algorithm for decoding names into phonetic codes, as
		pronounced in Portuguese. The goal is for homophones to be
		encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched
		despite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm mainly
		encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is
		the first letter. The soundex code resultant consists of a four
		digits long string composed by one letter followed by three
		numerical digits: the letter is the first letter of the name,
		and the digits encode the remaining consonants.
