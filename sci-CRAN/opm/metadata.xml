		Analysing Phenotype Microarray and Growth Curve Data // Tools for
		analysing OmniLog(R) and MicroStation(TM) phenotype microarray
		(PM) data as produced by the devices distributed by BIOLOG Inc.
		as well as similar kinds of data such as growth curves. Major
		facilities are plotting data, accurately estimating curve
		parameters, comparing and discretising data, creating
		phylogenetic formats and reports for taxonomic journals,
		drawing the PM analysis results in biochemical pathway graphs
		optionally including genome annotations, running multiple
		comparisons of means, easy interaction with powerful feature-
		selection approaches, integrating metadata, using the YAML
		format for the storage of data and metadata, batch conversion
		of large numbers of files, and database I/O. (The suggested
		mboostDevel is from R-Forge and not necessary.)
