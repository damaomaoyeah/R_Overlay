		Gene Network Inference from Time-Series Transcriptomic Data //
		The Time-Delay Correlation algorithm (TDCor) reconstructs the
		topology of a gene regulatory network (GRN) from time-series
		transcriptomic data.  The algorithm is described in details in
		Lavenus et al., Plant Cell, 2015.  It was initially developed
		to infer the topology of the GRN controlling lateral root
		formation in Arabidopsis thaliana.  The time-series
		transcriptomic dataset which was used in this study is included
		in the package to illustrate how to use it.
