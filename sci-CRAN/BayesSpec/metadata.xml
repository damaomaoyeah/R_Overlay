		Bayesian Spectral Analysis Techniques // An implementation of
		methods for spectral analysis using the Bayesian framework. It
		includes functions for modelling spectrum as well as
		appropriate plotting and output estimates. There is
		segmentation capability with RJ MCMC (Reversible Jump Markov
		Chain Monte Carlo). The package takes these methods
		predominantly from the 2012 paper "AdaptSPEC: Adaptive Spectral
		Estimation for Nonstationary Time Series"
		DOI:10.1080/01621459.2012.716340.
