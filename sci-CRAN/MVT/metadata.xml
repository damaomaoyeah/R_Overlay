		Estimation and Testing for the Multivariate t-Distribution //
		Routines to perform estimation and inference under the
		multivariate t-distribution. Currently, the following
		methodologies are implemented: multivariate mean and covariance
		estimation, hypothesis testing about the mean, equicorrelation
		and homogeneity of variances, the Wilson-Hilferty
		transformation, QQ-plots with envelopes and random variate
		generation. Some auxiliary functions are also provided.
