		Walk Score and Transit Score API // A collection of functions to
		perform the Application Programming Interface (API) calls
		associated with the Walk Score website (www.walkscore.com)
		within the R environment. These functions can be used to query
		the Walk Score and Transit Score database for a wide variety of
		information using R scripts. This package includes the simple
		Walk Score and Transit Score API calls, which return the scores
		associated with an input location, as well as calls which
		return some data used to calculate the scores. These functions
		are especially useful for mass data collection and gathering
		Walk Score and Transit Score values for large lists of
		locations.
