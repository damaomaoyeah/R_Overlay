		Analysis of Stable Matchings // Implements structural estimators
		to correct for the sample selection bias from observed outcomes
		in matching markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents
		into groups as well as two-sided matching of students to
		schools. The package also contains algorithms to find stable
		matchings in the three most common matching problems: the
		stable roommates problem, the college admissions problem, and
		the house allocation problem.
