		Tools to Hyphenate Strings Using the 'Hunspell' Hyphenation
		Library // Identifying hyphenation points in strings can be
		useful for both text processing and display functions. The
		'Hunspell' hyphenation library
		https://github.com/hunspell/hyphen provides tools to perform
		hyphenation using custom language rule dictionaries. Many
		hyphenation rules dictionaries are included. Words can be
		hyphenated directly or split into hyphenated component strings
		for further processing.
