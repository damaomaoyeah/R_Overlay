		Statistical Complexity and Information Measures for Time Series
		Analysis // An implementation of local and global statistical
		complexity measures (aka Information Theory Quantifiers, ITQ)
		for time series analysis based on ordinal statistics (Bandt and
		Pompe (2002) DOI:10.1103/PhysRevLett.88.174102). Several
		distance measures that operate on ordinal pattern
		distributions, auxiliary functions for ordinal pattern
		analysis, and generating functions for stochastic and
		deterministic-chaotic processes for ITQ testing are provided.
