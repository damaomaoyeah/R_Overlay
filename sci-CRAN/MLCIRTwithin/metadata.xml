		Latent Class Item Response Theory Models Under 'Within-Item
		Multi-Dimensionality' // Framework for the Item Response Theory
		analysis of dichotomous and ordinal polytomous outcomes under
		the assumption of within-item multi-dimensionality and
		discreteness of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow
		for missing responses and for different item parameterizations
		and are based on the Expectation-Maximization paradigm.
		Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be
		included in the new version.
