		Latent Class Item Response Theory (LC-IRT) Models under Within-
		Item Multidimensionality // Framework for the Item Response
		Theory analysis of dichotomous and ordinal polytomous outcomes
		under the assumption of within-item multidimensionality and
		discreteness of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow
		for missing responses and for different item parametrizations
		and are based on the Expectation-Maximization paradigm.
		Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be
		included in the new version.
