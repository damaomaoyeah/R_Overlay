		Multivariate Autoregressive Modeling for Analysis of Community
		Time-Series Data // The MAR1 package provides basic tools for
		preparing ecological community time-series data for MAR
		modeling, building MAR-1 models via model selection and
		bootstrapping, and visualizing and exporting model results. It
		is intended to make MAR analysis (sensu Ives et al. (2003)
		Analysis of community stability and ecological interactions
		from time-series data) a more accessible tool for anyone
		studying community dynamics.  The user need not necessarily be
		familiar with time-series modeling or command-based statistics
		programs such as R.
