		Selecting Spatial Scale of Covariates in Regression Models //
		Fits spatial scale (SS) forward stepwise regression, SS
		incremental forward stagewise regression, SS least angle
		regression (LARS), and SS lasso models.  All area-level
		covariates are considered at all available scales to enter a
		model, but the SS algorithms are constrained to select each
		area-level covariate at a single spatial scale.
