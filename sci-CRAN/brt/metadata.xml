		Biological Relevance Testing // Analyses of large-scale -omics
		datasets commonly use p-values as the indicators of statistical
		significance. However, considering p-value alone neglects the
		importance of effect size (i.e., the mean difference between
		groups) in determining the biological relevance of a
		significant difference. Here, we present a novel algorithm for
		computing a new statistic, the biological relevance testing
		(BRT) index, in the frequentist hypothesis testing framework to
		address this problem.
