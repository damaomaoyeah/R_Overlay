		Sparse Multivariate Analysis via Rank Transformation // The
		package "smart" provides a general framework for analyzing
		(including estimation, feature selection and prediction) and
		visualize big data. It integrates several novel, efficient and
		robust data analysis tools, including Transelliptical Component
		Analysis (TCA), Transelliptical Correlation Estimation (TCE)
		and Group Nearest Shrunken Centroids (gnsc). We target on high
		dimensional data analysis(usually d  n), and exploit
		computationally efficiently approaches. Results are organized
		to be visualized properly for users.
