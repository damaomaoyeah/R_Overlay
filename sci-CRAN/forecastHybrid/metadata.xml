		Convenient Functions for Ensemble Time Series Forecasts //
		Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
		approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated
		from auto.arima(), ets(), thetam(), nnetar(), stlm(), and
		tbats() can be combined with equal weights, weights based on
		in-sample errors, or CV weights. Cross validation for time
		series data and user-supplied models and forecasting functions
		is also supported to evaluate model accuracy.
