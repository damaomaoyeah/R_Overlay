		Principal Component Analysis in High-Dimensional Data // In high-
		dimensional settings: Estimate the number of distant spikes
		based on the Generalized Spiked Population (GSP) model.
		Estimate the population eigenvalues, angles between the sample
		and population eigenvectors, correlations between the sample
		and population PC scores, and the asymptotic shrinkage factors.
		Adjust the shrinkage bias in the predicted PC scores.
