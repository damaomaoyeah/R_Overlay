		Minimal Working Examples for Particle Metropolis-Hastings //
		Routines for state estimate in a linear Gaussian state space
		model and a simple stochastic volatility model using particle
		filtering. Parameter inference is also carried out in these
		models using the particle Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that
		includes the particle filter to provided an unbiased estimator
		of the likelihood. This package is a collection of minimal
		working examples of these algorithms and is only meant for
		educational use and as a start for learning to them on your
		own.
