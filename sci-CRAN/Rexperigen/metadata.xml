		R Interface to Experigen // Provides convenience functions to
		communicate with an Experigen server: Experigen
		(http://github.com/aquincum/experigen) is an online framework
		for creating  linguistic experiments, and it stores the results

		results from the server, and it is especially helpful with
		registered experiments, as authentication with the server has
		to happen.
