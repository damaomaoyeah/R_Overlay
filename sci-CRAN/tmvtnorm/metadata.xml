		Truncated Multivariate Normal and Student t Distribution //
		Random number generation for the truncated multivariate normal
		and Student t distribution. Computes probabilities, quantiles
		and densities, including one-dimensional and bivariate marginal
		densities. Computes first and second moments (i.e. mean and
		covariance matrix) for the double-truncated multinormal case.
