		Estimating Above-Ground Biomass and Its Uncertainty in Tropical
		Forests // Contains data analysis functions to estimate above-
		ground biomass and its uncertainty in tropical forests. BIOMASS
		functions allow to (1) retrieve and to correct taxonomy, (2)
		estimate wood density and its uncertainty, (3) construct
		height-diameter models, (4) estimate the above-ground biomass
		at the stand level with associated uncertainty.
