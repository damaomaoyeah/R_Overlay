		Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Its Uncertainty in Tropical
		Forests // Contains functions to estimate aboveground
		biomass/carbon and its uncertainty in tropical forests. These
		functions allow to (1) retrieve and to correct taxonomy, (2)
		estimate wood density and its uncertainty, (3) construct
		height-diameter models, (4) estimate the above-ground
		biomass/carbon at the stand level with associated uncertainty.
