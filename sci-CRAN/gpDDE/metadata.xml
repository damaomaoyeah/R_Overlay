		General Profiling Method for Delay Differential Equation //
		Functions implement collocation-inference for stochastic
		process driven by distributed delay differential equations.
		They also provide tools for selecting the lags for distributed
		delay using shrinkage methods, estimating time-varying
		coefficients, and tools for inference and prediction.
