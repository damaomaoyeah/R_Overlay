		Fit continuous-time correlated random walk models to animal
		movement data // The (C)orrelated (RA)ndom (W)alk (L)ibrary of
		R functions was designed for fitting continuous-time correlated
		random walk (CTCRW) models with time indexed covariates. The
		model is fit using the Kalman-Filter on a state space version
		of the continuous-time stochastic movement process.
