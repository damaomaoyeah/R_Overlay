		Fast Algorithms to Bootstrap Receiver Operating Characteristics
		Curves // Implements a very fast C++ algorithm to quickly
		bootstrap receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and
		derived performance metrics, including the area under the curve
		(AUC) and the partial area under the curve as well as the true
		and false positive rate. The analysis of paired receiver
		operating curves is supported as well, so that a comparison of
		two predictors is possible. You can also plot the results and
		calculate confidence intervals. On a typical desktop computer
		the time needed for the calculation of 100000 bootstrap
		replicates given 500 observations requires time on the order of
		magnitude of one second.
