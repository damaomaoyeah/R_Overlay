		Fast Algorithms to Bootstrap Receiver Operating Characteristics
		Curves // Implements a very fast C++ algorithm to quickly
		bootstrap receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and
		derived performance metrics, including the area under the curve
		(AUC) as well as the true and false positive rate. You can also
		plot the results and calculate confidence intervals. Currently
		the calculation of 100000 bootstrap replicates for 500
		observations takes about one second.
