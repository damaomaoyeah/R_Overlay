		Fused Lasso Latent Feature Model // Fits the Fused Lasso Latent
		Feature model, which is used for modeling multi-sample aCGH
		data to identify regions of copy number variation (CNV).
		Produces a set of features that describe the patterns of CNV
		and a set of weights that describe the composition of each
		sample.  Also provides functions for choosing the optimal
		tuning parameters and the appropriate number of features, and
		for estimating the false discovery rate.
