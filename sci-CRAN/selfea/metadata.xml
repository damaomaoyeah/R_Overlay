		Select Features Reliably with Cohen's Effect Sizes // Functions
		using Cohen's effect sizes (Cohen, Jacob. Statistical power
		analysis for the behavioral sciences. Academic press, 2013) are
		provided for reliable feature selection in biology data
		analysis.  In addition to Cohen's effect sizes, p-values are
		calculated and adjusted from quasi-Poisson GLM, negative
		binomial GLM and Normal distribution ANOVA.  Significant
		features (genes, RNAs or proteins) are selected by adjusted
		p-value and minimum Cohen's effect sizes, calculated to keep
		certain level of statistical power of biology data analysis
		given p-value threshold and sample size.
