		Random Forest for SNPs to Prevent X-chromosome SNP Importance
		Bias // A modification of Breiman and Cutler's classification
		random forests modified for SNP (Single Nucleotide
		Polymorphism) data (based on randomForest v4.6-7) to prevent
		X-chromosome SNP variable importance bias compared to autosomal
		SNPs by simulating the process of X chromosome inactivation.
		Classification is based on a forest of trees using random
		subsets of SNPs and other variables as inputs.
