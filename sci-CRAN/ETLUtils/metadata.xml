		Utility Functions to Execute Standard Extract/Transform/Load
		Operations (using Package 'ff') on Large Data // Provides
		functions to facilitate the use of the 'ff' package in
		interaction with big data in 'SQL' databases (e.g. in 'Oracle',
		'MySQL', 'PostgreSQL', 'Hive') by allowing easy importing
		directly into 'ffdf' objects using 'DBI', 'RODBC' and 'RJDBC'.
		Also contains some basic utility functions to do fast left
		outer join merging based on 'match', factorisation of data and
		a basic function for re-coding vectors.
