		A Predictive Model for Trait Based Community Assembly of Plant
		Species // Implements a predictive model of community assembly
		called 'Traitspace' (Laughlin et al. 2012, Ecology Letters).
		Traitspace is a hierarchical Bayesian model that translates the
		theory of trait-based environmental filtering into a
		statistical model that incorporates intraspecific trait
		variation to predict the relative abundances and the
		distributions of species. The package includes functions to
		plot the predicted and the observed values. It also includes
		functions to compare the predicted values against the observed
		values using a variety of different distance measures and to
		implement permutation tests to test their statistical
		significance.
