		Weighted Subspace Random Forest for Classification // A parallel
		implementation of Weighted Subspace Random Forest.  The
		Weighted Subspace Random Forest algorithm was proposed in the
		International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining,
		8(2):44-63, 2012, proposed by Baoxun Xu, Joshua Zhexue Huang,
		Graham Williams, Qiang Wang, and Yunming Ye.  The algorithm can
		classify very high-dimensional data with random forests built
		using small subspaces.  A novel variable weighting method is
		used for variable subspace selection in place of the
		traditional random variable sampling.This new approach is
		particularly useful in building models from high-dimensional
		data.
