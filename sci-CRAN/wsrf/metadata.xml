		Weighted Subspace Random Forest for Classification // A parallel
		implementation of Weighted Subspace Random Forest.  The
		Weighted Subspace Random Forest algorithm was proposed in the
		International Journal of Data Warehousing and Mining by Baoxun
		Xu, Joshua Zhexue Huang, Graham Williams, Qiang Wang, and
		Yunming Ye (2012) DOI:10.4018/jdwm.2012040103.  The algorithm
		can classify very high-dimensional data with random forests
		built using small subspaces.  A novel variable weighting method
		is used for variable subspace selection in place of the
		traditional random variable sampling.This new approach is
		particularly useful in building models from high-dimensional
		data.
