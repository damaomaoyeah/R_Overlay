		Prediction of Therapeutic Success // In personalized medicine,
		one wants to know, for a given patient and his or her outcome
		for a predictor (pre-treatment variable), how likely it is that
		a treatment will be more beneficial than an alternative
		treatment. This package allows for the quantification of the
		predictive causal association (i.e., the association between
		the predictor variable and the individual causal effect of the
		treatment) and related metrics. Part of this software has been
		developed using funding provided from the European Union's 7th
		Framework Programme for research, technological development and
		demonstration under Grant Agreement no 602552.
