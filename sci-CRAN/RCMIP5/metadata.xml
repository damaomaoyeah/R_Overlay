		Tools for Manipulating and Summarizing CMIP5 Data // Working with
		CMIP5 data can be tricky, forcing scientists to write custom
		scripts and programs. The `RCMIP5` package aims to ease this
		process, providing a standard, robust, and high-performance set
		of scripts to (i) explore what data have been downloaded, (ii)
		identify missing data, (iii) average (or apply other
		mathematical operations) across experimental ensembles, (iv)
		produce both temporal and spatial statistical summaries, and
		(v) produce easy-to-work-with graphical and data summaries.
