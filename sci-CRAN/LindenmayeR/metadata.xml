		Functions to Explore L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems) // L-systems
		or Lindenmayer systems are parallel rewriting systems which can
		be used to simulate biological forms and certain kinds of
		fractals. Briefly, in an L-system a series of symbols in a
		string are replaced iteratively according to rules to give a
		more complex string. Eventually, the symbols are translated
		into turtle graphics for plotting. Wikipedia has a very good
		introduction: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system This package
		provides basic functions for exploring L-systems.
