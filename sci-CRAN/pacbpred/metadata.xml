		PAC-Bayesian Estimation and Prediction in Sparse Additive Models.
		// This package is intended to perform estimation and
		prediction in high-dimensional additive models, using a sparse
		PAC-Bayesian point of view and a MCMC algorithm. The method is
		fully described in Guedj and Alquier (2013), 'PAC-Bayesian
		Estimation and Prediction in Sparse Additive Models',
		Electronic Journal of Statistics, 7, 264--291.
