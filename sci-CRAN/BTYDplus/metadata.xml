		Probabilistic Models for Assessing and Predicting your Customer
		Base // Provides advanced statistical methods to describe and
		predict customers' purchase behavior in a non-contractual
		setting. It uses historic transaction records to fit a
		probabilistic model, which then allows to compute quantities of
		managerial interest on a cohort- as well as on a customer level
		(Customer Lifetime Value, Customer Equity, P(alive), etc.).
		This package complements the BTYD package by providing several
		additional buy-till-you-die models, that have been published in
		the marketing literature, but whose implementation are complex
		and non-trivial. These models are: NBD, MBG/NBD, BG/CNBD-k,
		MBG/CNBD-k, Pareto/NBD (HB), Pareto/NBD (Abe) and Pareto/GGG.
