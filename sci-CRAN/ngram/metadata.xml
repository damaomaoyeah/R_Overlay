		Fast n-Gram 'Tokenization' // An n-gram is a sequence of n
		"words" taken, in order, from a body of text.  This is a
		collection of utilities for creating, displaying, summarizing,
		and "babbling" n-grams.  The 'tokenization' and "babbling" are
		handled by very efficient C code, which can even be built as
		its own standalone library. The babbler is a simple Markov
		chain.  The package also offers a vignette with complete
		example 'workflows' and information about the utilities offered
		in the package.
