		Fast n-Gram 'Tokenization' // An n-gram is a sequence of n
		"words" taken from a body of text in order.  This package
		offers utilities for creating, displaying, summarizing, and
		"babbling" n-grams.  The 'tokenization' and "babbling" are
		handled by very efficient C code, which can even be build as
		its own standalone library. The babbler is a simple Markov
		chain.  The package also offers a vignette with complete
		example 'workflows' and information about the utilities offered
		in the package.
