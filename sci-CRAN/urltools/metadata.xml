		Vectorised Tools for URL Handling and Parsing // A toolkit for
		handling URLs that so far includes functions for URL encoding
		and decoding, parsing, and parameter extraction. All functions
		are designed to be both fast and entirely vectorised. It is
		intended to be useful for people dealing with web-related
		datasets, such as server-side logs, although may be useful for
		other situations involving large sets of URLs.
