		Mapping Fisheries Data and Spatial Analysis Tools // This
		software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the
		Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo, British Columbia,
		Canada. It extends the R language to include two-dimensional
		plotting features similar to those commonly available in a
		Geographic Information System (GIS). Embedded C code speeds
		algorithms from computational geometry, such as finding
		polygons that contain specified point events or converting
		between longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator
		(UTM) coordinates. Additionally, we include C++ code developed
		by Angus Johnson for the Clipper library.  PBSmapping also
		includes data for a global shoreline and other data sets in the
		public domain. The R directory '.../library/PBSmapping/doc'
		offers a complete user's guide PBSmapping-UG.pdf, which should
		be consulted to use all functions in the package effectively.
