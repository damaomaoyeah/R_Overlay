		q-order partial correlation graph search algorithm // This
		package is deprecated and it is now only a stub for the newer
		version called qpgraph available through the Bioconductor
		project. The q-order partial correlation graph search
		algorithm, q-partial, or qp, algorithm for short, is a robust
		procedure for structure learning of undirected Gaussian
		graphical Markov models from "small n, large p" data, that is,
		multivariate normal data coming from a number of random
		variables p larger than the number of multidimensional data
		points n as in the case of, e.g., microarray data.
