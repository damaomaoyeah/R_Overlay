		Create graphics for the web from R. // Uses Protovis to provide
		web graphics for R (exposes most low-level functions).  Package
		is still under active development and shouldn't be considered
		stable until version 0.1.  Currently uses a web browser to
		process JavaScript, although future version will process
		JavaScript directly and return the SVG output.  Also does not
		properly support discrete labels (e.g. with histograms) or
		statistical functions.  See website for more details.
