		An Extended Rao-Stirling Diversity Index to Handle Missing Data
		// A collection of functions to compute the Rao-Stirling
		diversity index (Porter and Rafols, 2009)
		DOI:10.1007/s11192-008-2197-2 and its extension to acknowledge
		missing data (i.e.,   uncategorized references) by calculating
		its interval of uncertainty using      mathematical
		optimization as proposed in Calatrava et al. (2016)
		DOI:10.1007/s11192-016-1842-4. The Rao-Stirling diversity index
		is a well-established bibliometric indicator to measure the
		interdisciplinarity of scientific publications. Apart from the
		obligatory dataset of publications with their respective
		references and     a taxonomy of disciplines that categorizes
		references as well as a measure of similarity between the
		disciplines, the Rao-Stirling diversity index requires a
		complete categorization of all references of a publication into
		disciplines. Thus, it fails for a incomplete categorization; in
		this case, the robust extension has to be used, which encodes
		the uncertainty caused by missing bibliographic data as an
		uncertainty interval. Classification / ACM - 2012: Information
		systems ~ Similarity measures, Theory of computation ~
		Quadratic  programming, Applied computing ~ Digital libraries
		and archives.
