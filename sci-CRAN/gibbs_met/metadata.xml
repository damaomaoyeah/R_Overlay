		Naive Gibbs Sampling with Metropolis Steps // This package
		provides two generic functions for performing Markov chain
		sampling in a naive way for a user-defined target distribution,
		which involves only continuous variables. The function
		"gibbs_met" performs Gibbs sampling with each 1-dimensional
		distribution sampled with Metropolis update using Gaussian
		proposal distribution centered at the previous state. The
		function "met_gaussian" updates the whole state with Metropolis
		method using independent Gaussian proposal distribution
		centered at the previous state. The sampling is carried out
		without considering any special tricks for improving
		efficiency. This package is aimed at only routine applications
		of MCMC in moderate-dimensional problems.
