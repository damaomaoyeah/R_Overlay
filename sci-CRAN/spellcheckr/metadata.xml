		Correct the Spelling of a Given Word in the English Language //
		Corrects the spelling of a given word in English using a
		modification of Peter Norvig's spell correct algorithm (see
		http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) which handles up to three
		edits. The algorithm tries to find the spelling with maximum
		probability of intended correction out of all possible
		candidate corrections from the original word.
