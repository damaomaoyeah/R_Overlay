		'ViennaCL' C++ Header Files // 'ViennaCL' is a free open-source
		linear algebra library for computations on many-core
		architectures (GPUs, MIC) and multi-core CPUs. The library is
		written in C++ and supports 'CUDA', 'OpenCL', and 'OpenMP'
		(including switches at runtime). I have placed these libraries
		in this package as a more efficient distribution system for
		CRAN. The idea is that you can write a package that depends on
		the 'ViennaCL' library and yet you do not need to distribute a
		copy of this code with your package.
