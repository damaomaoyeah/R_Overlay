		A Bayesian Dose-Finding Design using Pharmacokinetics(PK) for
		Phase I Clinical Trials // Includes methods involving PK
		measures in the dose allocation process during a Phase I
		clinical trials. These methods enter PK in the dose finding
		designs in different ways, including covariates models,
		dependent variable or hierarchical models. This package
		provides functions to generate scenarios, and to run
		simulations which their objective is to determine the maximum
		tolerated dose (MTD) and to investigate PK of a drug or a
		combination of drugs.
