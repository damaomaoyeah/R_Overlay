		A Collection of Oversampling Techniques for Class Imbalance
		Problem Based on SMOTE // A collection of various oversampling
		techniques developed from SMOTE is provided. SMOTE is a
		oversampling technique which synthesizes a new minority
		instance between a pair of one minority instance and one of its
		K nearest neighbor. (see
		https://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf for more
		information) Other techniques adopt this concept with other
		criteria in order to generate balanced dataset for class
		imbalance problem.
