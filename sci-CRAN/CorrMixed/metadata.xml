		Estimate Correlations Between Repeatedly Measured Endpoints
		(E.g., Reliability) Based on Linear Mixed-Effects Models // In
		clinical practice and research settings in medicine and the
		behavioral sciences, it is often of interest to quantify the
		correlation of a continuous endpoint that was repeatedly
		measured (e.g., test-retest correlations, ICC, etc.). This
		package allows for estimating these correlations based on
		mixed-effects models. Part of this software has been developed
		using funding provided from the European Union's 7th Framework
		Programme for research, technological development and
		demonstration under Grant Agreement no 602552.
