		Segmenting Multiple Time Series by Contemporaneous Linear
		Transformation // To seek for a contemporaneous linear
		transformation for a multivariate time series such that the
		transformed series is segmented into several lower-dimensional
		subseries, and those subseries are uncorrelated with each other
		both contemporaneously and serially.
