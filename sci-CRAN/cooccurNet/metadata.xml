		Co-Occurrence Network // Read and preprocess fasta format data,
		and construct the co-occurrence network for downstream
		analyses. This R package is to construct the co-occurrence
		network with the algorithm developed by Du (Du 2008). It could
		be used to transform the data with high-dimension, such as DNA
		or protein sequence, into co-occurrence networks. Co-occurrence
		network could not only capture the co-variation pattern between
		variables, such as the positions in DNA or protein sequences,
		but also reflect the relationship between samples. Although it
		is originally used in DNA and protein sequences, it could be
		also used to other kinds of data, such as SNP.
