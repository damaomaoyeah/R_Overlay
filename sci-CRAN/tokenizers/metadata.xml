		A Consistent Interface to Tokenize Natural Language Text //
		Convert natural language text into tokens. The tokenizers have
		a consistent interface and are compatible with Unicode, thanks
		to being built on the 'stringi' package. Includes tokenizers
		for shingled n-grams, skip n-grams, words, word stems,
		sentences, paragraphs, characters, lines, and regular
		expressions.
