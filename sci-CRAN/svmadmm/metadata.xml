		Linear/Nonlinear SVM Classification Solver Based on ADMM and
		IADMM Algorithms // Solve large-scale regularised linear/kernel
		classification by using ADMM and IADMM algorithms. This package
		provides linear L2-regularised primal classification (both ADMM
		and IADMM are available), kernel L2-regularised dual
		classification (IADMM) as well as L1-regularised primal
		classification (both ADMM and IADMM are available).
