		Data fusion filters for Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS)
		with several variants of the Kalman filter and the Mahoney and
		Madgwick filters. // R implementation of data fusion filters
		for Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) based on Vlad
		Maximov's GyroLib AHRS library (quaternion based
		linearized/extended/unscented Kalman filter, Euler based LKF,
		gyro-free with vector matching, SVD calibration and EKF
		calibration), Sebastian O.H. Madgwick AHRS algorithms and
		Sebastian O.H. Madgwick implementation of Mayhony et al AHRS
		algorithm.
