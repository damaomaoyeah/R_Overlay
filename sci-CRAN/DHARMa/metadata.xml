		Residual Diagnostics for Hierarchical (Multi-Level / Mixed)
		Regression Models // The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-
		based approach to create readily interpretable scaled
		(quantile) residuals from fitted generalized linear mixed
		models. Currently supported are all 'merMod' classes from
		'lme4' ('lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from
		'MASS', but excluding quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model
		classes. Alternatively, externally created simulations, e.g.
		posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as
		'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. The
		resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1
		and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a
		linear regression. The package also provides a number of plot
		and test functions for typical model misspecification problem,
		such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and residual
		spatial and temporal autocorrelation.
