		Residual Diagnostics for Hierarchical (Multi-Level / Mixed)
		Regression Models // The 'DHARMa' package uses a simulation-
		based approach to create readily interpretable scaled
		(quantile) residuals from fitted generalized linear mixed
		models. Currently supported are 'lme4', 'glm' (except quasi-
		distributions) and 'lm' model classes. The resulting residuals
		are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be
		interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear
		regression. The package also provides a number of plot and test
		functions for typical model misspecification problem, such as
		over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and spatial and temporal
		autocorrelation.
