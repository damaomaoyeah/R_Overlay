		Fit Additive Hazards Models for Survival Analysis // Contains
		tools to fit the additive hazards model to data from a cohort,
		random sampling, two-phase Bernoulli sampling and two-phase
		finite population sampling, as well as calibration tool to
		incorporate phase I auxiliary information into the two-phase
		data model fitting.  This package provides regression parameter
		estimates and their model-based and robust standard errors. It
		also offers tools to make prediction of individual specific
		hazards.
