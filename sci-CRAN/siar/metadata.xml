		Stable Isotope Analysis in R // This package takes data on
		organism isotopes and fits a Bayesian model to their dietary
		habits based upon a Gaussian likelihood with a mixture
		dirichlet-distributed prior on the mean. It also includes SiBER
		metrics. See siardemo() for an example. Version 4.1.2 contains
		bug fixes to allow more than isotope numbers other than 2.
		Version 4.2 fixes a bug that stopped siar working on 64-bit
		systems
