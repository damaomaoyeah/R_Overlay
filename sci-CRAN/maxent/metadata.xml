		Low-memory Multinomial Logistic Regression with Support for Text
		Classification // maxent is an R package with tools for low-
		memory multinomial logistic regression, also known as maximum
		entropy. The focus of this maximum entropy classifier is to
		minimize memory consumption on very large datasets,
		particularly sparse document-term matrices represented by the
		tm package. The classifier is based on an efficient C++
		implementation written by Dr. Yoshimasa Tsuruoka.
