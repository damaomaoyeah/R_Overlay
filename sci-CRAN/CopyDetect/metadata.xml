		Computing Statistical Indices to Detect Answer Copying on
		Multiple-Choice Tests // CopyDetect contains several IRT and
		non-IRT based statistical indices proposed in the literature
		for detecting answer copying on multiple-choice examinations.
		CopyDetect includes the indices that have been shown as
		effective and reliable based on the simulation studies.
		CopyDetect provides results for the Omega index (Wollack,
		1996), Generalized Binomial Test (van der Linden  Sotaridona,
		2006), K index (Holland, 1996), K1 and K2 indices (Sotaridona
		Meijer, 2002), and S1 and S2 indices (Sotaridona  Meijer,
		2003).
