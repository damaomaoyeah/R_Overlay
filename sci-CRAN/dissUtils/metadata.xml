		Utilities for making pairwise comparisons of multivariate data //
		This package has extensible C++ code for computing
		dissimilarities between vectors. It also has a number of C++
		functions for assembling collections of dissimilarities. In
		particular, it lets you find a matrix of dissimilarities
		between the rows of two input matrices. There are also
		functions for finding the nearest neighbors of each row of a
		matrix, either within the matrix itself or within another
		matrix.
