		Using Fonts More Easily in R Graphs // Making it easy to use
		various types of fonts ('TrueType', 'OpenType', Type 1, web
		fonts, etc.) in R graphs, and supporting most output formats of
		R graphics including PNG, PDF and SVG. Text glyphs will be
		converted into polygons or raster images, hence after the plot
		has been created, it no longer relies on the font files. No
		external software such as Ghostscript is needed to use this
		package.
