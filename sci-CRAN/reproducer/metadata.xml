		Reproduce Statistical Analyses and Meta-Analyses // Includes data
		analysis functions (e.g., to calculate effect sizes and 95%
		Confidence Intervals (CI) on Standardised Effect Sizes (d) for
		ABBA cross-over repeated-measures experimental designs), data
		presentation functions (e.g., density curve overlaid on
		histogram), and the data sets analyzed in different research
		papers in software engineering (e.g., related to software
		defect prediction or multi-site experiment concerning the
		extent to which structured abstracts were clearer and more
		complete than conventional abstracts) to streamline
		reproducible research in software engineering.
