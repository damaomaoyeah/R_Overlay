		Provides a graphical user interface to connect with databases
		that use MySQL. // Using widgets provided by gWidgets this
		creates a nice usable interface to help facilitate the learning
		of SQL.  It also just gives a nice interface for more advanced
		users.  Not all features are provided in the GUI but it is
		possible for more advanced users to achieve these goals inside
		the GUI.
