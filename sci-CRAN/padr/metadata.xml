		Quickly Get Datetime Data Ready for Analysis // Transforms
		datetime data into a format ready for analysis. It offers two
		functionalities; aggregating data to a higher level interval
		(thicken) and imputing records where observations were absent
		(pad). It also offers a few functions that assist with filling
		missing values after padding.
