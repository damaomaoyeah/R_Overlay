		Permutations and Mallows Distributions // Includes functions to
		work with the Mallows, Generalized Mallows and Weighted Mallows
		Models. The considered distances are Kendall's-tau, Cayley,
		Hamming and Ulam and it includes functions for making
		inference, sampling and learning such distributions, some of
		which are novel in the literature. As a by-product, PerMallows
		also includes operations for permutations, paying special
		attention to those related with the Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Ulam
		and Hamming distances and the random generation of
		permutations.
