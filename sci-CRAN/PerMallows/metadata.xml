		Permutations and Mallows Distributions // Includes functions to
		work with the Mallows and Generalized Mallows Models. The
		considered distances are Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Hamming and
		Ulam and it includes functions for making inference, sampling
		and learning such distributions, some of which are novel in the
		literature. As a by-product, PerMallows also includes
		operations for permutations, paying special attention to those
		related with the Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Ulam and Hamming
		distances. It is also possible to generate random permutations
		at a given distance, or with a given number of inversions, or
		cycles, or fixed points or even with a given length on LIS
		(longest increasing subsequence).
