		Varying stimulus coefficient fMRI models in R // A varying
		coefficient on the stimulus effect is introduced into the
		voxelwise fMRI regression model. By this the effects of the
		canonical hemodynamic response function are allowed to vary
		with another variable, like for example time or a vigilance
		parameter.
