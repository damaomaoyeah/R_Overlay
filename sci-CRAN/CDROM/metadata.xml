		Phylogenetically Classifies Retention Mechanisms of Duplicate
		Genes from Gene Expression Data // Classification is based on
		the recently developed phylogenetic approach by Assis and
		Bachtrog (2013). The method classifies the evolutionary
		mechanisms retaining pairs of duplicate genes (conservation,
		neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or specialization)
		by comparing gene expression profiles of duplicate genes in one
		species to those of their single- copy ancestral genes in a
		sister species.
