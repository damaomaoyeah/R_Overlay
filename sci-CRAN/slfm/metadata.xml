		Tools for fitting sparse latent factor model // slfm is a set of
		tools to find coherent patterns in microarray data using a
		Bayesian sparse latent factor model. Considerable effort has
		been put into making slfm fast and memory efficient, turning it
		an interesting alternative to simpler methods in terms of
		execution time.
