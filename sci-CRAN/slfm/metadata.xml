		Tools for Fitting Sparse Latent Factor Model // Set of tools to
		find coherent patterns in microarray data using a Bayesian
		sparse latent factor model (Duarte and Mayrink 2015 - http://li
		nk.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-12454-4_15).
		Considerable effort has been put into making slfm fast and
		memory efficient, turning it an interesting alternative to
		simpler methods in terms of execution time. It implements
		versions of the SLFM using both type of mixtures: using a
		degenerate distribution or a very concentrated normal
		distribution for the spike part of the mixture. It also
		implements additional functions to help pre-process the data
		and fit the model for a large number of arrays.
