		Multiple Hypothesis Test Based on Distribution of p Values // A
		framework for multiple hypothesis testing based on distribution
		of p values. It is well known that the p values come from
		different distribution for null and alternatives, in this
		package we provide functions to detect that change. We provide
		a method for using the change in distribution of p values as a
		way to detect the true signals in the data.
