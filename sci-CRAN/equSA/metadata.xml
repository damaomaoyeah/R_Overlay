		Estimate a Single or Multiple Graphical Models and Construct
		Networks // Provides an equivalent measure of partial
		correlation coefficients for high-dimensional Gaussian
		Graphical Models to learn and visualize the underlying
		relationships between variables from single or multiple
		datasets. You can refer to Liang, F., Song, Q. and Qiu, P.
		(2015) doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1012391 for more detail. Based
		on this method, the package also provides the method for
		constructing networks for Next Generation Sequencing Data.
		Besides, it includes the method for jointly estimating Gaussian
		Graphical Models of multiple datasets.
