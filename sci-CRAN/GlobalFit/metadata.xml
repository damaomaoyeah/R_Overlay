		Bi-Level Optimization of Metabolic Network Models // Initial
		metabolic networks often inaccurately predict in-silico growth
		or non-growth if compared to in-vivo data. This package refines
		metabolic network models by making networks changes (i.e.,
		removing, adding, changing reversibility of reactions; adding
		and removing biomass metabolites) and simultaneously matching
		sets of experimental growth and non-growth data (e.g., KO-
		mutants, mutants grown under different media conditions,...)
