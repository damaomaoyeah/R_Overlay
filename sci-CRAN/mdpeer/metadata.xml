		Graph-Constrained Regression with Enhanced Regularization
		Parameters Selection // Performs graph-constrained
		regularization in which regularization parameters are selected
		with the use of a known fact of equivalence between penalized
		regression and Linear Mixed Model solutions. Provides
		implementation of three different regression methods where
		graph-constraints among coefficients are accounted for.
		'crPEER' (Partially Empirical Eigenvectors for Regression with
		Constant Ridge, Constant Ridge PEER) method utilizes additional
		Ridge term to handle the non-invertibility of a graph Laplacian
		matrix. 'vrPEER' (Variable Reduction PEER) method performs
		variable-reduction procedure to handle the non-invertibility of
		a graph Laplacian matrix. Finally, 'RidgePEER' method employs a
		penalty term being a linear combination of graph-originated and
		Ridge-originated penalty terms, whose two regularization
		parameters are ML estimators from corresponding Linear Mixed
		Model solution. Notably, in 'RidgePEER' method a graph-
		originated penalty term allows imposing similarity between
		coefficients based on graph information given whereas
		additional Ridge-originated penalty term facilitates parameters
		estimation: it reduces computational issues arising from
		singularity in a graph-originated penalty matrix and yields
		plausible results in situations when graph information is not
		informative or when it is unclear whether connectivities
		represented by a graph reflect similarities among corresponding
		coefficients.
