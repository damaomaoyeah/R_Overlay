		Centre of Mass Assessment and Consolidation of Trees // The
		centre of mass is a crucial data for arborists in order to
		consolidate a tree using steel or dynamic cables. Given field-
		recorded data on branchiness of a tree, the package: (i)
		computes and plots the centre of mass of the tree itself, (ii)
		computes branches slenderness coefficient in order to aid the
		arborist identify potentially dangerous branches, and (iii)
		computes the force acting on a ground plinth and its best
		position relating to the tree centre of mass, should the tree
		need to be stabilized by a steel cable.
