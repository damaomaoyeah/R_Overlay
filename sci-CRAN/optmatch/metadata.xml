		Functions for Optimal Matching // Provides routines for distance
		based bipartite matching to reduce covariate imbalance between
		treatment and control groups in observational studies. Routines
		are provided to generate distances from GLM models (propensity
		score matching) and formulas (Euclidean and Mahalanobis
		matching), stratified matching (exact matching), and calipers.
		Results of the fullmatch routine are guaranteed to provide
		minimum average within matched set distance.
