		Functions for Optimal Matching // Distance based bipartite
		matching using the RELAX-IV minimum cost flow solver, oriented
		to matching of treatment and control groups in observational
		studies. Routines are provided to generate distances from
		generalised linear models (propensity score matching), formulas
		giving variables on which to limit matched distances,
		stratified or exact matching directives, or calipers, alone or
		in combination.
