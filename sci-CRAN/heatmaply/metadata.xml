		Interactive Heat Maps Using 'plotly' // Create interactive
		heatmaps that are usable from the R console, in the 'RStudio'
		viewer pane, in 'R Markdown' documents, and in 'Shiny' apps.
		Hover the mouse pointer over a cell to show details or drag a
		rectangle to zoom. A heatmap is a popular graphical method for
		visualizing high-dimensional data, in which a table of numbers
		are encoded as a grid of colored cells. The rows and columns of
		the matrix are ordered to highlight patterns and are often
		accompanied by dendrograms. Heatmaps are used in many fields
		for visualizing observations, correlations, missing values
		patterns, and more. Interactive heatmaps allow the inspection
		of specific value by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as
		zooming into a region of the heatmap by dragging a rectangle
		around the relevant area. This work is based on the 'ggplot2'
		and 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar heatmaps as
		'd3heatmap', with the advantage of speed ('plotly.js' is able
		to handle larger size matrix), and the ability to zoom from the
		dendrogram panes.
