		Calculation of Sample Size and Power for ICC // Provides
		functions to calculate the requisite sample size for studies
		where ICC is the primary outcome. Can also be used for
		calculation of power. In both cases it allows the user to test
		the impact of changing input variables by calculating the
		outcome for several different values of input variables. Based
		off the work of Zou. Zou, G. Y. (2012). Sample size formulas
		for estimating intraclass correlation coefficients with
		precision and assurance. Statistics in medicine, 31(29),
		3972-3981.
