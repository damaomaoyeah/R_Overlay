		Bayesian Inference for Discrete Weibull Regression // A Bayesian
		regression model for discrete response, where the conditional
		distribution is modelled via a discrete Weibull distribution.
		This package provides an implementation of Metropolis-Hastings
		and Reversible-Jumps algorithms to draw samples from the
		posterior. It covers a wide range of regularizations through
		any two parameter prior. Examples are Laplace (Lasso), Gaussian
		(ridge), Uniform, Cauchy and customized priors like a mixture
		of priors. An extensive visual toolbox is included to check the
		validity of the results as well as several measures of
		goodness-of-fit.
