		Statistical Methods for Normalizing Metabolomics Data //
		Metabolomics data are inevitably subject to a component of
		unwanted variation, due to factors such as batch effects,
		matrix effects, and confounding biological variation. This
		package contains a collection of R functions which can be used
		to remove unwanted variation and obtain normalized metabolomics
		data.
