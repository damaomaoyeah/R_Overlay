		Calculates "vectorial Kappa", an index of congruence between
		patchy mosaics. // this package allows to quantify the
		congruence between two patchy mosaics or landscapes. This
		"vectorial Kappa" approach extends the principle of Cohen's
		Kappa index by calculating areas of intersected patches between
		two mosaics rather than agreement between pixels. It provides
		an exact alternative for patchy mosaics when a Kappa index is
		needed.
