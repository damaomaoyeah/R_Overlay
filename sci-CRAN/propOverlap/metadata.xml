		Feature (gene) selection based on the Proportional Overlapping
		Scores // A package for selecting the most relevant features
		(genes) in the high-dimensional binary classification problems.
		The discriminative features are identified using analyzing the
		overlap between the expression values across both classes. The
		package includes functions for measuring the proportional
		overlapping score for each gene avoiding the outliers effect.
		The used measure for the overlap is the one defined in the
		"Proportional Overlapping Score (POS)" technique for feature
		selection. A gene mask which represents a gene's classification
		power can also be produced for each gene (feature). The set
		size of the selected genes might be set by the user. The
		minimum set of genes that correctly classify the maximum number
		of the given tissue samples (observations) can be also
		produced.
