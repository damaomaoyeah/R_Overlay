		Bayesian Tensor Factorization // Bayesian Tensor Factorization
		for decomposition of tensor data sets using the trilinear
		CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) factorization, with automatic component
		selection. The complete data analysis pipeline is provided,
		including functions and recommendations for data normalization
		and model definition, as well as missing value prediction and
		model visualization. The method performs factorization for
		three-way tensor datasets and the inference is implemented with
		Gibbs sampling.
