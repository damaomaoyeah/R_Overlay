		Pathwise Calibrated Sparse Shooting Algorithm // Implement a new
		family of efficient algorithms, called PathwIse CalibrAted
		Sparse Shooting AlgOrithm, for a variety of sparse learning
		problems, including Sparse Linear Regression, Sparse Logistic
		Regression, Sparse Column Inverse Operator and Sparse
		Multivariate Regression. Different types of active set
		identification schemes are implemented, such as cyclic search,
		greedy search, stochastic search and proximal gradient search.
		Besides, the package provides the choices between convex (L1
		norm) and non-convex (MCP and SCAD) regularizations. Moreover,
		group regularization, such as group Lasso, group MCP and group
		SCAD, are also implemented for Sparse Linear Regression, Sparse
		Logistic Regression and Sparse Multivariate Regression.
