		Pathwise Calibrated Sparse Shooting Algorithm // Implement the
		pathwise calibrated sparse shooting algorithm (PICASSO) for
		high dimensional regularized sparse linear regression, sparse
		logistic regression, and sparse undirected graphical model
		estimation. As a pathwise coordinate optimization algorithm,
		PICASSO exploits warm start initialization, active set
		updating, and strong rule for coordinate preselection to boost
		computation, and attains a linear convergence to a unique
		sparse local optimum with optimal statistical properties.
		Moreover, users can choose different regularizers, including
		L1, MCP, and SCAD regularizers. The computation is memory-
		optimized using the sparse matrix output.
