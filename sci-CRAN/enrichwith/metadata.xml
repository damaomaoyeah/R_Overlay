		Methods to Enrich R Objects with Extra Components // Provides the
		"enrich" method to enrich list-like R objects with new,
		relevant components. The current version has methods for
		enriching objects of class 'family', 'link-glm' and 'glm'. The
		resulting objects preserve their class, so all methods
		associated with them still apply. The package can also be used
		to produce customisable source code templates for the
		structured implementation of methods to compute new components.
