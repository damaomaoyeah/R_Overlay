		Accessing Csound functionality through R // Provides basic access
		in an R session to Csound http://www.csounds.com, a powerful
		free and open-source software sound synthesizer. The package
		functionality is largely geared towards supporting the needs of
		the playitbyr package for sonification and is not particularly
		mature on its own. But it certainly can be used without knowing
		anything about playitbyr.
