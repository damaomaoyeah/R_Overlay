		The package implements different data-driven method for
		unbalanced datasets // A dataset is said to be unbalanced when
		the class of interest (minority class) is much rarer than
		normal behaviour (majority class). The cost of missing a
		minority class is typically much higher that missing a majority
		class. Most learning systems are not prepared to cope with
		unbalanced data. Proposed strategies essentially belong to the
		following categories: sampling and distance-based. Sampling
		techniques up-sample or down-sample a class of instances. SMOTE
		generates synthetic minority examples. Distance based
		techniques use distances between input points to under-sample
		or to remove noisy and borderline examples.
