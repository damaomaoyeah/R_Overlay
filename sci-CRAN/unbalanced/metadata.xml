		Racing for Unbalanced Methods Selection // A dataset is said to
		be unbalanced when the class of interest (minority class) is
		much rarer than normal behaviour (majority class). The cost of
		missing a minority class is typically much higher that missing
		a majority class. Most learning systems are not prepared to
		cope with unbalanced data and several techniques have been
		proposed. This package implements some of most well-known
		techniques and propose a racing algorithm to select adaptively
		the most appropriate strategy for a given unbalanced task.
