		Focused, Interactive Multidimensional Scaling // Takes a distance
		matrix and plots it as an interactive graph. Double click on
		any point to choose a new focus point, and hover over points to
		see their ID labels. In this graph, one point is focused on at
		the center of the graph. All other points are plotted around
		this central point at their exact distances to the point, as
		given in the distance matrix. In other words, the distance
		between each point and the focus point are the true distances
		given in the distance matrix. The non focus points are plotted
		with respect to each other as exactly as possible. For more
		details, see https://lea-urpa.github.io/focusedMDS.html.
