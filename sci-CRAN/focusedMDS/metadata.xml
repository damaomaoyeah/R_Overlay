		Focused, Interactive Multidimensional Scaling // Takes a distance
		matrix and plots it as an interactive graph. One point is
		focused at the center of the graph, around which all other
		points are plotted in their exact distances as given in the
		distance matrix. All other non-focus points are plotted as best
		as possible in relation to one another. Double click on any
		point to choose a new focus point, and hover over points to see
		their ID labels. If color label categories are given, hover
		over colors in the legend to highlight only those points and
		click on colors to highlight multiple groups. For more
		information on the rationale and mathematical background, as
		well as an interactive introduction, see https://lea-
		urpa.github.io/focusedMDS.html.
