		A reporting pipeline for checking population pharmacokinetic
		model assumption // PKreport aims to 1) provide automatic
		pipeline for users to visualize data and models. It creates a
		flexible R framework with automatically generated R scripts to
		save time and cost for later usage; 2) implement an archive-
		oriented management tool for users to store, retrieve and
		modify figures. 3) offer powerful and convenient service to
		generate high-quality graphs based on two R packages: lattice
		and ggplot2.
