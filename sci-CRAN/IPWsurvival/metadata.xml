		Propensity Score Based Adjusted Survival Curves and Corresponding
		Log-Rank Statistic // In observational studies, the presence of
		confounding factors is common and the comparison of different
		groups of subjects requires adjustment. In this package, we
		propose simple functions to estimate adjusted survival curves
		and log-rank test based on inverse probability weighting (IPW).
