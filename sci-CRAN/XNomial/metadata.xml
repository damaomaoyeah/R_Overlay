		Exact Goodness-Of-Fit Test For Multinomial Data With Fixed
		Probabilities // Tests whether a set of counts fit a given
		expected ratio. For example, a genetic cross might be expected
		to produce four types in the relative frequencies of 9:3:3:1.
		To see whether a set of observed counts fits this expectation,
		one can examine all possible outcomes (multi) or a random
		sample of them (xmonte) and find the probability of an
		observation deviating from the expectation by at least as much
		as the observed. As a measure of deviation from the expected,
		one can use the log-likelihood ratio, the multinomial
		probability, or the classic chi-square statistic. A histogram
		of the test statistic can also be plotted and compared with the
		asymptotic curve.
