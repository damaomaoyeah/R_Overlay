		Generates binomial random numbers via the coupling from the past
		algorithm // Binomial random numbers are generated via the
		perfect sampling algorithm. At each iteration dual markov
		chains are generated and coalescence is checked. In case
		coalescence occurs, the resulting number is outputted. In case
		not, then the algorithm is restarted from T(t)=2*T(t) until
		coalescence occurs.
