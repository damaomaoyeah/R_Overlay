		Robust Performance Hypothesis Testing with the Sharpe Ratio //
		Applied researchers often test for the difference of the Sharpe
		ratios of two investment strategies. A very popular tool to
		this end is the test of Jobson and Korkie, which has been
		corrected by Memmel. Unfortunately, this test is not valid when
		returns have tails heavier than the normal distribution or are
		of time series nature. Instead, we propose the use of robust
		inference methods. In particular, we suggest to construct a
		studentized time series bootstrap confidence interval for the
		difference of the Sharpe ratios and to declare the two ratios
		different if zero is not contained in the obtained interval.
		This approach has the advantage that one can simply resample
		from the observed data as opposed to some null-restricted data.
