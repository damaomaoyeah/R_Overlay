		Automated measure-based classification for flint tools // TIPOM
		is based on a methodology that was developed in the 1960s by
		Bernardino Bagolini. The basic idea is to use the three simple
		dimensions of length, width and thickness of each lithic
		artefact to classify them in discrete groups and infer their
		function.
