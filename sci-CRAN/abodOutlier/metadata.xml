		Angle-Based Outlier Detection // Performs angle-based outlier
		detection on a given dataframe. Three methods are available, a
		full but slow implementation using all the data that has cubic
		complexity, a fully randomized one which is way more efficient
		and another using k-nearest neighbours. These algorithms are
		specially well suited for high dimensional data outlier
		detection.
