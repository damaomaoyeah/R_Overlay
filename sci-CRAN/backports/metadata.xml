		Reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0 //
		Provides implementations of functions which have been
		introduced in R since version 3.0.0. The backports are
		conditionally exported which results in R resolving the
		function names to the version shipped with R (if available) and
		uses the implemented backports as fallback. This way package
		developers can make use of the new functions without worrying
		about the minimum required R version.
