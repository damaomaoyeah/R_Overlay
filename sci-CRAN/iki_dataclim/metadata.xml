		Consistency, Homogeneity and Summary Statistics of Climatological
		Data // The package offers an S4 infrastructure to store
		climatological station data of various temporal aggregation
		scales. In-built quality control and homogeneity tests follow
		the methodology from the European Climate Assessment  Dataset
		project. Wrappers for climate indices defined by the Expert
		Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), a quick
		summary of important climate statistics and climate diagram
		plots provide a fast overview of climatological characteristics
		of the station.
