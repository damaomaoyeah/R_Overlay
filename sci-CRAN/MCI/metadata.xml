		Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) Model // Market area
		models are used to analyze and predict store choices and market
		areas concerning retail and service locations. This package
		implements two market area models (Huff Model, Multiplicative
		Competitive Interaction Model) into R, while the emphases lie
		on 1.) fitting these models based on empirical data via OLS
		regression and nonlinear techniques and 2.) data preparation
		and processing (esp. interaction matrices and data preparation
		for the MCI Model).
