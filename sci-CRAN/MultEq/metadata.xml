		Multiple Equivalence Tests and Simultaneous Confidence Intervals
		// Equivalence tests and related confidence intervals for the
		comparison of two treatments, simultaneously for one or many
		normally distributed, primary response variables (endpoints).
		The step-up procedure of Quan et al. (2001) is both applied for
		differences and extended to ratios of means. A related single-
		step procedure is also available.
