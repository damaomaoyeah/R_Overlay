		Weighted Linear Fixed Effects Regression Models for Causal
		Inference // This R package provides a computationally
		efficient way of fitting weighted linear fixed effects
		estimators for causal inference with various weighting schemes.
		Imai and Kim (2012) show that weighted linear fixed effects
		estimators can be used to estimate the average treatment
		effects under different identification strategies.  This
		includes stratified randomized experiments, matching and
		stratification for observational studies, first differencing,
		and difference-in-differences.  The package also provides
		various robust standard errors and a specification test for
		standard linear fixed effects estimators.
