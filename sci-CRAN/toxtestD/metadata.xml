		Experimental design for binary toxicity tests // Calculates
		sample size and dose allocation for binary toxicity tests,
		using the Fish Embryo Toxicity Test as example. An optimal test
		design is obtained by running (i) spoD (calculate the number of
		individuals to test under control conditions), (ii) setD
		(estimate the minimal sample size per treatment given the users
		precision requirements) and (iii) doseD (construct an
		individual dose scheme).
