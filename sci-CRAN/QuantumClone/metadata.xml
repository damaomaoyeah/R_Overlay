		Clustering Mutations using High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) Data
		// Using HTS data, clusters mutations in order to recreate
		putative clones from the data provided. It requires genotype at
		the location of the variant as well as the depth of coverage
		and number of reads supporting the mutation. Additional
		information may be provided, such as the contamination in the
		tumor sample. This package also provides a function
		QuantumCat() which simulates data obtained from tumor
		sequencing. Latest version can be found at
		github/DeveauP/QuantumClone .
