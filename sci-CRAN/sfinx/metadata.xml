		Straightforward Filtering Index for AP-MS Data Analysis (SFINX)
		// The straightforward filtering index (SFINX) identifies true
		positive protein interactions in a fast, user-friendly, and
		highly accurate way. It is not only useful for the filtering of
		affinity purification - mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data, but
		also for similar types of data resulting from other co-complex
		interactomics technologies, such as TAP-MS, Virotrap and BioID.
		SFINX can also be used via the website interface at
		http://sfinx.ugent.be.
