		Variational Bayes Discrete Mixture Model // Efficient algorithm
		for solving discrete mixture regression model for rare variant
		association analysis. Uses variational Bayes algorithm to
		efficiently search over model space.  Outputs an approximate
		likelihood ratio test as well as variant level posterior
		probabilities of association.
