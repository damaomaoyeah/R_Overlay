		Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf // Statistical utilities for the
		analysis of data by means of the Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf
		distribution. By plotting the probabilities in log-log scale,
		this two parameter distribution allows a concave as well as a
		convex behavior of the function at the beginning of the
		distribution, maintaining the linearity in the tail. The model
		contains the Zipf model as a particular case.
