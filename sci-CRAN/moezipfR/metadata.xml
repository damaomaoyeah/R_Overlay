		Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf // Statistical utilities for the
		analysis of data by means of the Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf
		distribution are presented. The distribution is a two-parameter
		extension of the widely used Zipf model. By plotting the
		probabilities in log-log scale, this two-parameter extension
		allows a concave as well as a convex behavior of the function
		at the beginning of the distribution, maintaining the
		linearity, associated to the Zipf model, in the tail.
