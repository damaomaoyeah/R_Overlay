		Tools for classification and regression trees, with an emphasis
		on interpretability. // This package is based on the code of
		the rpart package. It extends rpart by adding additional
		splitting methods emphasizing interpretable/parsimonious trees.
		Unless indicated otherwise, it is safe to assume that all
		functions herein are extensions of or copied directly from
		similar or nearly identical rpart methods.  As such, the
		authors of rpart are authors of this package as well.  However,
		please direct any error reports or other questions about itree
		to the maintainer of this package; they are welcome and
		appreciated.
