		Likelihood-Based Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) Dose Finding
		Designs // Provides the setup and calculations needed to run a
		likelihood-based continual reassessment method (CRM) dose
		finding trial and performs simulations to assess design
		performance under various scenarios. 3 dose finding designs are
		included in this package: ordinal proportional odds model (POM)
		CRM, ordinal continuation ratio (CR) model CRM, and the binary
		2-parameter logistic model CRM. These functions allow
		customization of design characteristics to vary sample size,
		cohort sizes, target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rates,
		discrete or continuous dose levels, combining ordinal grades 0
		and 1 into one category, and incorporate safety and/or stopping
		rules. For POM and CR model designs, ordinal toxicity grades
		are specified by common terminology criteria for adverse events
		(CTCAE) version 4.0. Function 'pseudodata' creates the
		necessary starting models for these 3 designs, and function
		'nextdose' estimates the next dose to test in a cohort of
		patients for a target DLT rate. We also provide the function
		'crmsimulations' to assess the performance of these 3 dose
		finding designs under various scenarios.
