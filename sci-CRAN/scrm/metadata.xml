		Simulating the Evolution of Biological Sequences // A coalescent
		simulator that allows the rapid simulation of biological
		sequences under neutral models of evolution. Different to other
		coalescent based simulations, it has an optional approximation
		parameter that allows for high accuracy while maintaining a
		linear run time cost for long sequences. It is optimized for
		simulating massive data sets as produced by Next- Generation
		Sequencing technologies for up to several thousand sequences.
