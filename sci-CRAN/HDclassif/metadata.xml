		High Dimensional Supervised Classification and Clustering //
		Discriminant analysis and data clustering methods for high
		dimensional data, based on the assumption that high-dimensional
		data live in different subspaces with low dimensionality
		proposing a new parametrization of the Gaussian mixture model
		which combines the ideas of dimension reduction and constraints
		on the model.
