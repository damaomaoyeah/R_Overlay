		Network Generation and Comparison // This package contains
		functions to carry out high throughput data analysis and to
		conduct data set comparisons. Similarity matrices from high
		throughput phenotypic data containing uninformative (e.g. wild
		type) or missing data can be calculated to report similarity of
		response.  A suite of graph comparisons using an adjacency or
		correlation matrix format are included to facilitate quick
		network analysis.
