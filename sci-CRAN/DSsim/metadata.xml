		Distance Sampling Simulations // Performs distance sampling
		simulations. It repeatedly generates instances of a user
		defined population within a given survey region, generates
		realisations of a survey design (currently these must be pre-
		generated using Distance software) and simulates the detection
		process. The data are then analysed so that the results can be
		compared for accuracy and precision across all replications.
		This will allow users to select survey designs which will give
		them the best accuracy and precision given their expectations
		about population distribution. Any uncertainty in population
		distribution or population parameters can be included by
		running the different survey designs for a number of different
		population descriptions. An example simulation can be found in
		the help file for make.simulation.
