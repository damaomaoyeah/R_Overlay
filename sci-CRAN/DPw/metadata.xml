		Semi- and nonparametric Bayesian Subset Selection Procedures //
		Implement the Bayesian subset selection procedure proposed in
		the paper titled "Bayesian Subset Selection Procedures with an
		Application to Lumber Strength Properties" by Yumi Kondo, James
		V. Zidek, Carolyn Taylor, and Constance van Eeden. This
		procedure models the lumber strengths with Dirichlet processes
		(DP) with the Weibull components and finds, with pre-specified
		certainty, the smallest subset that contains those species
		having the smallest alpha-th quantile of strength (i.e., the
		weakest species). We consider two models for the strengths: [1]
		A semi-parametric model which assumes that strengths are from
		the DP mixture of Weibulls; [2] the nonparametric model which
		assumes that probability measures of strengths are from DP with
		Weibull base distribution. Either model can be used to estimate
		the posterior probability that a subset contains the weakest
		species.
