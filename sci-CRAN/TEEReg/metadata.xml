		Trimmed Elemental Estimation for Linear Models // For fitting
		multiple linear regressions, the ordinary least squares
		approach is sensitive to outliers and/or violations of model
		assumptions. The trimmed elemental estimators are more robust
		to such situations. This package contains functions for
		computing the trimmed elemental estimates, as well as for
		creating the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap
		confidence intervals based on elemental regressions.
