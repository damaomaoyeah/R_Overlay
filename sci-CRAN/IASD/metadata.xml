		Model selection for index of asymmetry distribution // Calculate
		AIC's and AICc's of unimodal model (one normal distribution)
		and bimodal model(a mixture of two normal distributions) which
		fit the distribution of indices of asymmetry (IAS), and plot
		their density, to help determine IAS distribution is unimodel
		or bimodal.
