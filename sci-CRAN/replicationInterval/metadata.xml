		Replication Interval Functions // A common problem faced by
		journal reviewers and authors is the question of whether the
		results of a replication study are consistent with the original
		published study. One solution to this problem is to examine the
		effect size from the published study and generate the range of
		effect sizes that could reasonably be obtained (due to random
		sampling) in a replication attempt (i.e., calculate a
		replication interval). If a replication effect size falls
		outside the replication interval then that value could not have
		occurred to due the effects of sampling error alone.
		Alternatively, if a replication effect size falls within the
		replication interval then the replication results could have
		reasonably occurred due to the effects of sampling error alone.
		This package has functions that calculate the replication
		interval for two different types of effect sizes, namely
		correlation (i.e., r) and the standardized mean difference
		(i.e., d-value).
