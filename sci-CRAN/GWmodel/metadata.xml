		Geographically-Weighted Models // In GWmodel, we introduce
		techniques from a particular branch of spatial
		statistics,termed geographically-weighted (GW) models. GW
		models suit situations when data are not described well by some
		global model, but where there are spatial regions where a
		suitably localised calibration provides a better description.
		GWmodel includes functions to calibrate: GW summary statistics,
		GW principal components analysis, GW discriminant analysis and
		various forms of GW regression; some of which are provided in
		basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.
