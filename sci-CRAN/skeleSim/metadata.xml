		Genetic Simulation Engine // A shiny interface and supporting
		tools to guide users in choosing appropriate simulations,
		setting parameters, calculating summary genetic statistics, and
		organizing data output, all within the R environment. In
		addition to supporting existing forward and reverse-time
		simulators, new simulators can be integrated into the
		environment relatively easily.
