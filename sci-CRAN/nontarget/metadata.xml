		Detecting Isotope, Adduct and Homologue Relations in LC-MS Data
		// Screening a HRMS data set for peaks related by (1) isotope
		patterns, (2) different adducts of the same molecule and/or (3)
		homologue series. The resulting isotopic pattern and adduct
		groups can then be combined to so-called components, with
		homologue series information attached. Also allows plotting and
		filtering HRMS data for mass defects, frequent m/z distances
		and components vs. non-components.
