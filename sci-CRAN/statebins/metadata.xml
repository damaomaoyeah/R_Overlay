		statebins is an alternative to choropleth maps for USA States
		and is based on work by the Washington Post graphics department
		in their report on "The states most threatened by trade".
		statebins preserves as much of the geographic placement of the
		states as possible but has the look and feel of a traditional
		heatmap. Functions are provided that allow for use of both a
		binned, discrete scale and continuous scale depending on what
		is needed for the underlying data.
