		U.S. State Cartogram Heatmaps in R; an Alternative to Choropleth
		Maps for USA States // Cartogram heatmaps are an alternative to
		choropleth maps for USA States and are based on work by the
		Washington Post graphics department in their report on "The
		states most threatened by trade". "State bins" preserve as much
		of the geographic placement of the states as possible but has
		the look and feel of a traditional heatmap. Functions are
		provided that allow for use of a binned, discrete scale, a
		continuous scale or manually specified colors depending on what
		is needed for the underlying data.
