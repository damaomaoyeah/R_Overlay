		Computing Subscores in Classical Test Theory // Functions for
		computing test subscores using methods applicable to classical
		test theory (CTT) scores. This package enables two sets of
		subscoring methods within the framework of CTT: (1) Wainer's
		augmentation method, and (2) Haberman's three subscoring
		methods. The package also includes the function to compute
		Proportional Reduction of Mean Squared Errors (PRMSEs) proposed
		by Haberman's, which are used to examine whether test subscores
		are of added value.
