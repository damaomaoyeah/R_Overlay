		Computing Subscores in Classical Test Theory and Item Response
		Theory // Functions for computing subscores for a test using
		different methods in both classical test theory (CTT) and item
		response theory (IRT). This package enables three sets of
		subscoring methods within the framework of CTT and IRT:
		Wainer's augmentation method, Haberman's three subscoring
		methods, and Yen's objective performance index (OPI). The
		package also includes the function to compute Proportional
		Reduction of Mean Squared Errors (PRMSEs) in Haberman's methods
		which are used to examine whether test subscores are of added
		value.
