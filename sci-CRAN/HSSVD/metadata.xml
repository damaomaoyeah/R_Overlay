		Biclustering with Heterogeneous Variance // A data mining tool
		for discovering subgroups of patients and genes that
		simultaneously display unusual levels of variability compared
		to other genes and patients. Based on sparse singular value
		decomposition (SSVD), the method can detect both mean and
		variance biclusters in the presence of heterogeneous residual
		variance.
