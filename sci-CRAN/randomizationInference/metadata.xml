		Flexible Randomization-Based Inference // Allows the user to
		conduct randomization-based inference for a wide variety of
		experimental scenarios. The package leverages a potential
		outcomes framework to output randomization-based p-values and
		null intervals for test statistics geared toward any estimands
		of interest, according to the specified null and alternative
		hypotheses. Users can define custom randomization schemes so
		that the randomization distributions are accurate for their
		experimental settings. The package also creates visualizations
		of randomization distributions and can test multiple test
		statistics simultaneously.
