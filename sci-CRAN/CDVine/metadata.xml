		Statistical Inference of C- And D-Vine Copulas // Functions for
		statistical inference of canonical vine (C-vine) and D-vine
		copulas. Tools for bivariate exploratory data analysis and for
		bivariate as well as vine copula selection are provided. Models
		can be estimated either sequentially or by joint maximum
		likelihood estimation. Sampling algorithms and plotting methods
		are also included. Data is assumed to lie in the unit hypercube
		(so-called copula data).
