		Statistical inference of C- and D-vine copulas // This package
		provides functions for statistical inference of canonical vine
		(C-vine) and D-vine copulas. It contains tools for bivariate
		exploratory data analysis and for bivariate as well as vine
		copula selection. Models can be estimated either sequentially
		or by joint maximum likelihood estimation. Sampling algorithms
		and plotting methods are also included. Data is assumed to lie
		in the unit hypercube (so-called copula data).
