		Camera Trap Data Management and Preparation of Occupancy and
		Spatial Capture-Recapture Analyses // Management of and data
		extraction from camera trap photographs in wildlife studies.
		The package provides a workflow for storing and sorting camera
		trap photographs, computes record databases and detection/non-
		detection matrices for occupancy and spatial capture-recapture
		analyses with great flexibility. In addition, it provides
		simple mapping functions (number of species, number of
		independent species detections by station) and can visualise
		activity data.
