		Camera Trap Photograph Management and Preparation of Occupancy
		Analyses // Management of and data extraction from camera trap
		photographs in wildlife studies. The package provides a
		workflow for storing and sorting camera trap photographs,
		computes record databases and detection/non-detection matrices
		for occupancy analysis with great flexibility. In addition, it
		provides simple mapping functions (number of species, number of
		independent species detections by station) and can plot
		activity data using various functions (using package overlap
		and adapting function from the plotrix package).
