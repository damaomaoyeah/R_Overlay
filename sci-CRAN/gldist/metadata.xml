		An Asymmetry-Steepness Parameterization of the Generalized Lambda
		Distribution. // The generalized lambda distribution (GLD) is a
		versatile distribution that can accommodate a wide range of
		shapes, including fat-tailed and asymmetric distributions. This
		package implements a more intuitive parameterization of the GLD
		that expresses the location and scale parameters directly as
		the median and inter-quartile range of the distribution. The
		remaining two shape parameters characterize the asymmetry and
		steepness of the distribution respectively. The fitting of the
		GLD to empirical data can be reduced to a two-parameter
		estimation problem where the location and scale parameters are
		estimated by their robust sample estimators. Moreover, the
		parameterization can be used to compare data sets in a
		convenient asymmetry and steepness shape plot. The underline C
		routines are written such that compilers that support
		vectorized mathematical operations can automatically vectorize
		the most time consuming loops (tested with icc 12.1.0). The
		package includes the usual distribution functions, fitting
		routines and a shape plot function.
