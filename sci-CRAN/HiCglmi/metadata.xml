		Probing Factor-Dependent Long-Range Contacts using Regression
		with Higher-Order Interaction Terms // We propose a generalized
		linear regression with higher-order interaction terms to assess
		the influences of genomic features such as DNA-binding proteins
		and functional elements on long-range contacts from Hi-C
		experiments.
