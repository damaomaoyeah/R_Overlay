		Create and Manipulate Discrete Random Variables // Create,
		manipulate, transform, and simulate from discrete random
		variables. The syntax is modeled after that which is used in
		mathematical statistics and probability courses, but with
		powerful support for more advanced probability calculations.
		This includes the creation of joint random variables, and the
		derivation and manipulation of their conditional and marginal
		distributions.
