		Make dealing with dates a little easier // Lubridate makes it
		easier to work with dates and times by providing functions to
		identify and parse date-time data, extract and modify
		components of a date-time (years, months, days, hours, minutes,
		and seconds), perform accurate math on date-times, handle time
		zones and Daylight Savings Time. Lubridate has a consistent,
		memorable syntax, that makes working with dates fun instead of
		frustrating.
