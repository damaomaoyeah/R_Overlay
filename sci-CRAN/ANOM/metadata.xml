		Analysis of Means // Analysis of means (ANOM) as used in
		technometrical computing. The package takes results from
		multiple comparisons with the grand mean (obtained with
		multcomp, SimComp, nparcomp, or MCPAN) or corresponding
		simultaneous confidence intervals as input and produces ANOM
		decision charts that illustrate which group means deviate
		significantly from the grand mean.
