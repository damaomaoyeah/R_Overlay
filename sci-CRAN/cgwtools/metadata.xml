		Miscellaneous Tools // A set of tools the author has found useful
		for performing quick observations or evaluations of data,
		including a variety of ways to list objects by size, class,
		etc. Several other tools mimic Unix shell commands, including
		'head', 'tail' ,'pushd' ,and 'popd'. The functions 'seqle' and
		'reverse.seqle' mimic the base 'rle' but can search for linear
		sequences. The function 'splatnd' allows the user to generate
		zero-argument commands without the need for 'makeActiveBinding'
		.
