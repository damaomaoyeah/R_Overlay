		Reproducibility for Interval-Censored Data // This package
		calculates intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for
		assessing reproducibility of interval-censored data with two
		repeated measurements. ICC is estimated by maximum likelihood
		from model with one fixed and one random effect (both
		intercepts). Help in model checking (normality of subjects'
		means and residuals) is provided.
