		Fits Stickbreaking, Multiplicative and Additive Models to Data //
		Genetically modified organisms are used to test the phenotypic
		effects of mutation. Often, multiple substitutions impact
		organismal fitness differently than single substitutions
		(epistatic interactions). This package fits three basic models
		(additive, multiplicative, and stickbreaking) to fitness data
		and suggests the best fitting model by multinomial regression.
		Stickbreaker can also be used to simulate fitness data.
