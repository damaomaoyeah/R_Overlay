		Cluster analysis via nonparametric density estimation // The
		package performs cluster analysis via nonparametric density
		estimation. Operationally, the kernel method is used throughout
		to estimate the density. Diagnostics methods for evaluating the
		quality of the clustering are available. The package includes
		also a routine to estimate the probability density function
		obtained by the kernel method, given a set of data with
		arbitrary dimensions.
