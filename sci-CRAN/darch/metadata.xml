		Package for Deep Architectures and Restricted Boltzmann Machines
		// The darch package is built on the basis of the code from G.
		E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov (available under Matlab Code
		for deep belief nets). This package is for generating neural
		networks with many layers (deep architectures) and train them
		with the method introduced by the publications "A fast learning
		algorithm for deep belief nets" (G. E. Hinton, S. Osindero, Y.
		W. Teh; doi: 10.1162/neco.2006.18.7.1527) and "Reducing the
		dimensionality of data with neural networks" (G. E. Hinton, R.
		R. Salakhutdinov; doi: 10.1126/science.1127647). This method
		includes a pre training with the contrastive divergence method
		published by G.E Hinton (2002; doi: 10.1162/089976602760128018)
		and a fine tuning with common known training algorithms like
		backpropagation or conjugate gradients. Additionally,
		supervised fine-tuning can be enhanced with maxout and dropout,
		two recently developed techniques to improve fine-tuning for
		deep learning.
