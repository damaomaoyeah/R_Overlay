		Package for deep architectures and Restricted-Bolzmann-Machines
		// The darch package is build on the basis of the code from G.
		E. Hinton and R. R. Salakhutdinov (available under Matlab Code
		for deep belief nets : last visit: 01.08.2013). This package is
		for generating neural networks with many layers (deep
		architectures) and train them with the method introduced by the
		publications "A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets"
		(G. E. Hinton, S. Osindero, Y. W. Teh) and "Reducing the
		dimensionality of data with neural networks" (G. E. Hinton, R.
		R. Salakhutdinov). This method includes a pre training with the
		contrastive divergence method publishing by G.E Hinton (2002)
		and a fine tuning with common known training algorithms like
		backpropagation or conjugate gradient.
