		Read Data from Delimited 'MTConnect' Data Files and Perform some
		Analysis // Read data in the
		'MTConnect'http://www.mtconnect.org/ standard. You can use the
		package to read data from historical 'MTConnect logs' along
		with the 'devices.xml' describing the device. The data is
		organised into a 'MTConnectDevice' S4 data structure and some
		convenience methods are also provided for basic read/view
		operations. The package also includes some functions for
		analysis of 'MTConnect' data. This includes functions to
		simulate data (primarily position data, feed rate and
		velocities) based on the G code and visualisation functions to
		compare the actual and simulated data.
