		Visualising Molecular Dynamics Analyses // Provides
		automatization for plot generation succeeding common molecular
		dynamics analyses. This includes straightforward plots, such as
		RMSD (Root-Mean-Square-Deviation) and RMSF (Root-Mean-Square-
		Fluctuation) but also more sophisticated ones such as dihedral
		angle maps, hydrogen bonds, cluster bar plots and DSSP
		(Definition of Secondary Structure of Proteins) analysis.
