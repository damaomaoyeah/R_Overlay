		Simultaneous manipulation of multiple arrays of data, with
		data.list objects // Data frames are integral to R.  They
		provide a standard format for passing data to model-fitting and
		plotting functions, and this standard makes it easier for
		experienced users to learn new functions that accept data as a
		single data frame.  Still, many data sets do not easily fit
		into a single data frame; data sets in ecology with a so-called
		fourth-corner problem provide important examples. Manipulating
		such inherently multiple-table data using several data frames
		can result in long and difficult-to-read work-flows.  This
		package provides new data storage objects called data.list
		objects, which extend the data.frame concept to explicitly
		multiple-table settings.  Like data frames, data lists are
		lists of variables stored as vectors; what is new is that these
		vectors have dimension attributes that make accessing and
		manipulating them easier.  As data.list objects can be coerced
		to data.frame objects, they can be used with all R functions
		that accept an object that can be coerced to a data.frame.
