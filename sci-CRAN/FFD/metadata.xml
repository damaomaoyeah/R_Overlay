		Freedom from Disease // Functions, S4 classes/methods and a
		graphical user interface (GUI) to design surveys to
		substantiate freedom from disease using a modified
		hypergeometric function (see Cameron and Baldock, 1997). Herd
		sensitivities are computed according to sampling strategies
		"individual sampling" or "limited sampling" (see M. Ziller, T.
		Selhorst, J. Teuffert, M. Kramer and H. Schlueter, 2002).
		Methods to compute the a-posteriori alpha-error are
		implemented. Risk-based targeted sampling is supported.
