		Bayesian Network Feature Finder // Provides a full package of
		posterior inference, model comparison, and graphical
		illustration of model fitting. A parallel computing algorithm
		for the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based posterior
		inference and an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm
		for posterior approximation are are developed, both of which
		greatly reduce the computational time for model inference.
