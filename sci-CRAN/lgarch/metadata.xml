		Simulation and Estimation of Log-GARCH Models // Simulation and
		estimation of univariate and multivariate log-GARCH models. The
		main functions of the package are: lgarchSim(), mlgarchSim(),
		lgarch() and mlgarch(). The first two functions simulate from a
		univariate and a multivariate log-GARCH model, respectively,
		whereas the latter two estimate a univariate and multivariate
