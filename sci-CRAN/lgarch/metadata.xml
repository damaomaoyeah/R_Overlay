		Simulation and estimation of log-GARCH models // Simulation and
		estimation of univariate and multivariate log-GARCH models. The
		main functions of the package are: lgarchSim, mlgarchSim,
		lgarch and mlgarch. The first two functions simulate from a
		univariate and a multivariate log-GARCH model, respectively,
		whereas the latter two estimate a univariate and multivariate
		log-GARCH model, respectively. A collection of methods can be
		applied to objects of both the 'lgarch' and 'mlgarch' types:
		coef, fitted, logLik, print, residuals, summary and vcov.
