		Statistical Analysis of Mixed Ploidy Populations // StAMPP allows
		users to calculate pairwise Nei's Genetic Distances (Nei 1972),
		pairwise Fixation Indexes (Fst) (Weir  Cockerham 1984) and also
		Genomic Relationship matrixes following Yang et al. (2010) in
		mixed and single ploidy populations. Bootstrapping across loci
		is implemented during Fst calculation to generate confidence
		intervals and p-values around pairwise Fst values. StAMPP
		utilises SNP genotype data of any ploidy level (with the
		ability to handle missing data) and is coded to utilise
		multithreading where available to allow efficient analysis of
		large datasets. StAMPP is able to handle genotype data from
		genlight objects allowing integration with other packages such
		adegenet. Please refer to LW Pembleton, NOI Cogan  JW Forster,
		2013, Molecular Ecology Resources, 13(5), 946-952.

		user manual. Thank you in advance.
