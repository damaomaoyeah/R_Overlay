		Explore life histories // Biograph is designed to facilitate the
		descriptive and statistical analysis of life histories.  It
		follows a multistate perspective on the life course and
		conceptualizes the life course as a sequence of states and
		transitions between states (events). Transitions are governed
		by transition rates that depend on event counts and exposure
		times. Transition rates also depend on covariates. Biograph
		produces useful graphics and computes life-course indicators
		for individuals and groups. The package structures the data for
		multistate statistical and demographic modeling of life
		histories. The package accepts data in a Biograph format. The
		Doc subdirectory of the package contains a description of how
		to prepare Biograph objects. It includes several illustrations
		and R code.
