		Simultaneous Tolerance Bounds // Provides an implementation of
		simultaneous tolerance bounds (STB), useful for checking
		whether a numeric vector fits to a hypothetical null-
		distribution or not. Furthermore, there are functions for
		computing STB (bands, intervals) for random variates of linear
		mixed models fitted with package 'VCA'. All kinds of, possibly
		transformed (studentized, standardized, Pearson-type
		transformed) random variates (residuals, random effects), can
		be assessed employing STB-methodology.
