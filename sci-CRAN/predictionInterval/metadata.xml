		Prediction Interval Functions for Assessing Replication Study
		Results // A common problem faced by journal reviewers and
		authors is the question of whether the results of a replication
		study are consistent with the original published study. One
		solution to this problem is to examine the effect size from the
		original study and generate the range of effect sizes that
		could reasonably be obtained (due to random sampling) in a
		replication attempt (i.e., calculate a prediction interval).
		This package has functions that calculate the prediction
		interval for the correlation (i.e., r), standardized mean
		difference (i.e., d-value), and mean.
