		Calculate efficiencies of group testing algorithms with
		correlated responses // This package provides functions to
		calculate the efficiencies (expected tests per unit) of
		hierarchical and matrix group testing procedures.  Efficiencies
		can be calculated in the presense of correlated responses under
		multiple arrangements of clustesrs.  Efficiencies can also be
		evaluated in the presense of test error.
