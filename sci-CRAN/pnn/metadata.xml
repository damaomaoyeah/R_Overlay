		Probabilistic neural networks // The program pnn implements the
		algorithm proposed by Specht (1990).  It is written in the R
		statistical language. It solves a common problem in automatic
		learning. Knowing a set of observations described by a vector
		of quantitative variables, we classify them in a given number
		of groups. Then, the algorithm is trained with this datasets
		and should guess afterwards the group of any new observation.
		This neural network has the main advantage to begin
		generalization instantaneously even with a small set of known
		observations. It is delivered with four functions (learn,
		smooth, perf and guess) and a dataset. The functions are
		documented with examples and provided with unit tests.
