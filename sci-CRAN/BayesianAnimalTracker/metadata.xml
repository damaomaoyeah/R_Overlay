		Bayesian Melding of GPS and DR Path for Animal Tracking //
		Bayesian melding approach to combine the GPS observations and
		Dead-Reckoned path for an accurate animal's track, or
		equivalently, use the GPS observations to correct the Dead-
		Reckoned path. It can take the measurement errors in the GPS
		observations into account and provide uncertainty statement
		about the corrected path. The main calculation can be done by
		the BMAnimalTrack function.
