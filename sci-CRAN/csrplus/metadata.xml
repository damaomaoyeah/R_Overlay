		Methods to Test Hypotheses on the Distribution of Spatial Point
		Processes // Includes two functions to evaluate the hypothesis
		of complete spatial randomness (csr) in point processes.  The
		function 'mwin' calculates quadrat counts to estimate the
		intensity of a spatial point process through the moving window
		approach proposed by Bailey and Gatrell (1995).  Event counts
		are computed within a window of a set size over a fine lattice
		of points within the region of observation.  The function
		'pielou' uses the nearest neighbor test statistic and
		asymptotic distribution proposed by Pielou (1959) to compare
		the observed point process to one generated under csr.  The
		value can be compared to that given by the more widely used
		test proposed by Clark and Evans (1954).
