		Fitting Frailty Models with the EM Algorithm // Contains
		functions for fitting shared frailty models with a semi-
		parametric baseline hazard with the Expectation-Maximization
		algorithm. Supported data formats include clustered failures
		with left truncation and recurrent events in gap-time or
		Andersen-Gill format. Several frailty distributions, such as
		the the gamma, positive stable and the Power Variance Family
		are supported.
