		A Fast Solver for Parameterized Linear Programming Problems and
		Constrained L1 Minimization Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix
		Estimation // An efficient method of recovering precision
		matrices by applying the parametric simplex method is provided
		in this package. The computation is based on a linear
		optimization solver. It also contains a generic Linear
		Programming solver and a parameterized Linear Programming
		solver based on the parametric simplex method.
