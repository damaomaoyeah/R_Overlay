		A Fast Solver for Parameterized LP Problems, Constrained L1
		Minimization Approach to Sparse Precision Matrix Estimation and
		Dantzig Selector // Provides a method of recovering the
		precision matrix efficiently and solving for the dantzig
		selector by applying the parametric simplex method.  The
		computation is based on a linear optimization solver. It also
		contains a generic LP solver and a parameterized LP solver
		using parametric simplex method.
