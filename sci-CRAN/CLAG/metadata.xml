		An unsupervised non hierarchical clustering algorithm handling
		biological data // CLAG (for CLusters AGgregation) is an
		unsupervised non hierarchical clustering algorithm designed to
		cluster a large variety of biological data and to provide a
		clustered matrix and numerical values indicating cluster
		strength. CLAG clusterizes correlation matrices for residues in
		protein families, gene-expression and miRNA data related to
		various cancer types, sets of species described by
		multidimensional vectors of characters, binary matrices. It
		does not ask to all data points to cluster and it converges
		yielding the same result at each run. Its simplicity and speed
		allows it to run on reasonably large datasets.
