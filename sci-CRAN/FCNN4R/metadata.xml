		Fast Compressed Neural Networks for R // The FCNN4R package
		provides an interface to kernel routines from the FCNN C++
		library. FCNN is based on a completely new Artificial Neural
		Network representation that offers unmatched efficiency,
		modularity, and extensibility. FCNN4R provides standard
		teaching (backpropagation, Rprop) and pruning algorithms
		(minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon), but it is first and
		foremost an efficient computational engine. Users can easily
		implement their algorithms by taking advantage of fast gradient
		computing routines, as well as network reconstruction
		functionality (removing weights and redundant neurons).
