		Fast Compressed Neural Networks for R // Provides an interface to
		kernel routines from the FCNN C++ library. FCNN is based on a
		completely new Artificial Neural Network representation that
		offers unmatched efficiency, modularity, and extensibility.
		FCNN4R provides standard teaching (backpropagation, Rprop,
		simulated annealing, stochastic gradient) and pruning
		algorithms (minimum magnitude, Optimal Brain Surgeon), but it
		is first and foremost an efficient computational engine. Users
		can easily implement their algorithms by taking advantage of
		fast gradient computing routines, as well as network
		reconstruction functionality (removing weights and redundant
		neurons, reordering inputs, merging networks). Networks can be
		exported to C functions in order to integrate them into
		virtually any software solution.
