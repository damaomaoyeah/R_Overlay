		Imperialist Competitive Algorithm for Optimal Designs // Finding
		locally D-optimal, minimax D-optimal, standardized maximin
		D-optimal, optim-on-the-average and multiple objective optimal
		designs for nonlinear models. Different Fisher information
		matrices can also be set by user. There are also  useful
		functions for verifying the optimality of the designs with
		respect to different criteria by equivalence theorem. ICA is a
		meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm inspired from the socio-
		political process of humans. See Masoudi et al. (2016)
