		Pricing Equity Derivatives with Extensions of Black-Scholes //
		Algorithms to price American and European equity options,
		convertible bonds and a variety of other financial derivatives.
		It uses an extension of the usual Black-Scholes model in which
		jump to default may occur at a probability specified by a
		power-law link between stock price and hazard rate as found in
		the paper by Takahashi, Kobayashi, and Nakagawa (2001)
		doi:10.3905/jfi.2001.319302.  We use ideas and techniques from
		Andersen and Buffum (2002) doi:10.2139/ssrn.355308 and Linetsky
