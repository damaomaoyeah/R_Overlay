		Detect and Test Regular Sequences and Subsequences // For a
		sequence of event occurence times, we are interested in finding
		subsequences in it that are too "regular". We define regular as
		being significantly different from a homogeneous Poisson
		process. The departure from the Poisson process is measured
		using a L1 distance. See Di and Perlman 2007 for more details.
