		Post-Processing of the Markov Chain Simulated by 'ChronoModel' or
		'Oxcal' // Provides a list of functions for the statistical
		analysis of archaeological phases. It is based on the post-
		processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution
		is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such MCMC
		output can be simulated by different applications as for
		instance 'ChronoModel' (see http://www.chronomodel.fr) or
		'Oxcal' (see https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html). The only
		requirement is to have a CSV file containing a sample from the
		posterior distribution.
