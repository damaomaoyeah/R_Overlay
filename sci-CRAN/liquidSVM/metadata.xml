		(SVMs) and related kernel-based learning algorithms are a well-
		known class of machine learning algorithms, for non- parametric
		classification and regression. liquidSVM is an implementation
		of SVMs whose key features are: fully integrated hyper-
		parameter selection, extreme speed on both small and large data
		sets, inclusion of a variety of different classification and
		regression scenarios, and full flexibility for experts.
