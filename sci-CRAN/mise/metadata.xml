		Clears the Workspace (Mise en Place) // Clears the workspace.
		Useful for the beginnings of R scripts, to avoid potential
		problems with accidentally using information from variables or
		functions from previous script evaluations, too many figure
		windows open at the same time, packages that you don't need any
		more, or a cluttered console.  Uses code from various
		StackOverflow users.  See help(mise) for pointers to the
		relevant StackOverflow pages.
