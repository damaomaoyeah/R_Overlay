		Adaptive Smoothing of FMRI Data // This package contains R
		functions for estimating the blood oxygenation level dependent
		(BOLD) effect by using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
		(fMRI) data, based on adaptive Gauss Markov random fields, for
		real as well as simulated data. The implemented simulations
		make use of efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
