		Quick and Dirty Estimates for Wildlife Populations // Provides
		simple, fast functions for maximum likelihood and Bayesian
		estimates of wildlife population parameters, suitable for use
		with simulated data or bootstraps. Early versions were indeed
		quick and dirty, but optional error-checking routines and
		meaningful error messages have been added. Includes single and
		multi-season occupancy, closed capture population estimation,
		survival, species richness and distance measures.
