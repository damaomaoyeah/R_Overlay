		Block Gibbs Sampler with Incomplete Multinomial Distribution //
		Implement an efficient block Gibbs sampler with incomplete data
		from a multinomial distribution taking values from the k
		categories 1,2,...,k, where data are assumed to miss at random
		and each missing datum belongs to one and only one of m
		distinct non-empty proper subsets A1, A2,..., Am of 1,2,...,k
		and the k categories are labelled such that only consecutive
		A's may overlap.
