		Response Surface Analysis // Advanced response surface analysis.
		The main function RSA computes and compares several nested
		polynomial regression models (full polynomial, shifted and
		rotated squared differences, rising ridge surfaces, basic
		squared differences). The package provides plotting functions
		for 3d wireframe surfaces, interactive 3d plots, and contour
		plots. Calculates many surface parameters (a1 to a4, principal
		axes, stationary point, eigenvalues) and provides standard,
		robust, or bootstrapped standard errors and confidence
		intervals for them.
