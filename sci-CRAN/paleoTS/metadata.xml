		Analyze Paleontological Time-Series // Facilitates analysis of
		paleontological sequences of trait values from an evolving
		lineage.  Functions are provided to fit, using maximum
		likelihood, evolutionary models including unbiased random
		walks, directional evolution, stasis, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,
		punctuated change, and evolutionary models in which traits
		track some measured covariate.
