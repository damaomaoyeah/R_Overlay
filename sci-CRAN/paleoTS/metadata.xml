		Analyze paleontological time-series // This package facilitates
		analysis of paleontological sequences of trait values from an
		evolving lineage.  Functions are provided to fit, using maximum
		likelihood, evolutionary models including unbiased random
		walks, directional evolution, stasis, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck,
		punctuated change, and evolutionary models in which traits
		track some measured covariate.
