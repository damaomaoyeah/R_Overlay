		Self Calibrating Quantile-Quantile Plots for Visual Testing //
		Provides the function qqtest which incorporates uncertainty in
		its qqplot display(s) so that the user might have a better
		sense of the evidence against the specified distributional
		hypothesis.  qqtest draws a quantile quantile plot for visually
		assessing whether the data come from a test distribution that
		has been defined in one of many ways.  The vertical axis plots
		the data quantiles, the horizontal those of a test
		distribution. The default behaviour generates 1000 samples from
		the test distribution and overlays the plot with shaded
		pointwise interval estimates for the ordered quantiles from the
		test distribution.  A small number of independently generated
		exemplar quantile plots can also be overlaid.  Both the
		interval estimates and the exemplars provide different
		comparative information to assess the evidence provided by the
		qqplot for or against the hypothesis that the data come from
		the test distribution (default is normal or gaussian).
		Finally, a visual test of significance (a lineup plot) can also
		be displayed to test the null hypothesis that the data come
		from the test distribution.
