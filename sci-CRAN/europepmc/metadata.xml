		R Interface to the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service //
		An R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service.
		It gives access to both metadata on life science literature and
		open access full texts. Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content
		and other literature sources including Agricola, a
		bibliographic database of citations to the agricultural
		literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to bibliographic
		metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and
		reference lists. Links between life-science literature and
		other EBI databases, including ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also
		accessible. No registration or API key is required. See the
		vignettes for usage examples.
