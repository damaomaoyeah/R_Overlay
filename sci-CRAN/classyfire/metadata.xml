		Robust multivariate classification using highly optimised SVM
		ensembles // A collection of functions for the creation and
		application of highly optimised, robustly evaluated ensembles
		of support vector machines (SVMs). The package takes care of
		training individual SVM classifiers using a fast parallel
		heuristic algorithm, and combines individual classifiers into
		ensembles. Robust metrics of classification performance are
		offered by bootstrap resampling and permutation testing.
