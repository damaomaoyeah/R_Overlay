		Interface to the 'HDF5' Library // S4 Interface to the 'HDF5'
		library supporting fast storage and retrieval of R-objects like
		vectors, matrices and arrays to binary files in a language
		independent format. The 'HDF5' format can therefore be used as
		an alternative to R's save/load mechanism. Since h5 is able to
		access only subsets of stored data it can also handle data sets
		which do not fit into memory.
