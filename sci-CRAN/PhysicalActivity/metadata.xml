		Process Physical Activity Accelerometer Data // This package
		contains functions to classify monitor wear and nonwear time
		intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess physical
		activity in free-living condition. The package also contains
		functions to make plot for accelerometer data, and to obtain
		the summary of daily monitor wear time and the mean of monitor
		wear time during valid days. A monitored day is considered
		valid if the total minutes of classified monitor wear time per
		day is greater than a user defined cutoff.
