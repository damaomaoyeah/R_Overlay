		Generating and Testing DNA Sequences // Generates DNA sequences
		based on Markov model techniques for matched sequences. This
		can be generalized to several sequences. The sequences (taxa)
		are then arranged in an evolutionary tree (phylogenetic tree)
		depicting how taxa diverge from their common ancestors. This
		gives the tests and estimation methods for the parameters of
		different models. Standard phylogenetic methods assume
		stationarity, homogeneity and reversibility for the Markov
		processes, and  often impose further restrictions on the
		parameters.
