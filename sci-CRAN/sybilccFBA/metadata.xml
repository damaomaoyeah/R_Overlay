		Cost Constrained FLux Balance Analysis: MetabOlic Modeling with
		ENzyme kineTics (MOMENT) // An implementation of a cost
		constrained flux balance analysis technique (i.e. MetabOlic
		Modeling with ENzyme kineTics (MOMENT)). MOMENT uses enzyme
		kinetic data and enzyme molecular weights to constrain flux
		balance analysis(FBA) and it is described in Adadi, R.,
		Volkmer, B., Milo, R., Heinemann, M.,  Shlomi, T. (2012).
		Prediction of Microbial Growth Rate versus Biomass Yield by a
		Metabolic Network with Kinetic Parameters, 8(7).
		doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002575. This package also implements
		an improvement of MOMENT that considers multi-functional
		enzymes. FBA is a mathematical technique to find fluxes in
		metabolic models at steady state. It is described in Orth,
		J.D., Thiele, I. and Palsson, B.O.  What is flux balance
		analysis? Nat. Biotech. 28, 245-248(2010).
