		Find the maximum likelihood estimator of the shape constrained
		hazard baseline and the effect parameters in the Cox
		proportional hazards model // This package computes the maximum
		likelihood estimator (MLE) of the shape-constrained hazard
		baseline and the effect parameters in the Cox proportional
		hazards model under IID sampling.  We assume that the data are
		continuous and allow for right censoring.  The function
		'find.shapeMLE' allows for four different shape constraints:
		increasing, decreasing, unimodal, and u-shaped.
