		An Implementation of the Bridge Distribution with Logit-Link as
		in Wang and Louis (2003) // An implementation of the bridge
		distribution with logit-link in R. In Wang and Louis (2003)
		DOI:10.1093/biomet/90.4.765, such a univariate bridge
		distribution was derived as the distribution of the random
		intercept that 'bridged' a marginal logistic regression and a
		conditional logistic regression. The conditional and marginal
		regression coefficients are a scalar multiple of each other.
		Such is not the case if the random intercept distribution was
		Gaussian.
