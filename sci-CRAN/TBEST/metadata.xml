		Tree Branches Evaluated Statistically for Tightness // Our method
		introduces mathematically well-defined measures for tightness
		of branches in a hierarchical tree. Statistical significance of
		the findings is determined, for all branches of the tree, by
		performing permutation tests, optionally with generalized
		Pareto p-value estimation.
