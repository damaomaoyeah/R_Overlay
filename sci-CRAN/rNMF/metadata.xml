		Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization // An implementation of
		robust nonnegative matrix factorization (rNMF). The rNMF
		algorithm decomposes a nonnegative high dimension data matrix
		into the product of two low rank nonnegative matrices, while
		detecting and trimming outliers. The main function is rnmf().
		The package also includes a visualization tool, see(), that
		arranges and prints vectorized images.
