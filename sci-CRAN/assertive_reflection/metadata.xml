		Assertions for Checking the State of R // A set of predicates and
		assertions for checking the state and capabilities of R, the
		operating system it is running on, and the IDE being used.
		This is mainly for use by other package developers who want to
		include run-time testing features in their own packages. End-
		users will usually want to use assertive directly.
