		The package will formally test two curves represented by discrete
		data sets to be statistically equal or not when the errors of
		the two curves were assumed either equal or not using the tube
		formula to calculate the tail probabilities. // Test Equality
		of Curves with Homoscedastic or Heteroscedastic Errors.
