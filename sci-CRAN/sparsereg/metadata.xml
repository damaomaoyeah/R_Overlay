		Sparse Bayesian Models for Regression, Subgroup Analysis, and
		Panel Data // Sparse modeling provides a mean selecting a small
		number of non-zero effects from a large possible number of
		candidate effects.  This package includes a suite of methods
		for sparse modeling: estimation via EM or MCMC, approximate
		confidence intervals with nominal coverage, and diagnostic and
		summary plots.  Beyond regression analyses, applications
		include subgroup analysis, particularly for conjoint
		experiments, and panel data. Future versions will include
		extensions to limited dependent variables, models with
		truncated outcomes, and propensity score and instrumental
		variable analysis.
