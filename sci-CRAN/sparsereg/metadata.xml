		Sparse Bayesian Models for Regression, Subgroup Analysis, and
		Panel Data // Sparse modeling provides a mean selecting a small
		number of non-zero effects from a large possible number of
		candidate effects.  This package includes a suite of methods
		for sparse modeling.  Beyond regression analyses, applications
		include subgroup analysis, particularly for conjoint
		experiments, and panel data.  Functionality for dichotomous and
		censored outcome (Types I and II tobit) is also included.
		Future plans involve extending the method to propensity score
		and instrumental variable methods.
