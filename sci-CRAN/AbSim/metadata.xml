		Time Resolved Simulations of Antibody Repertoires // Simulation
		methods for the evolution of antibody repertoires. The heavy
		chain variable region of both human and C57BL/6 mice can be
		simulated in a time-dependent fashion. Both single lineages
		using one set of V-, D-, and J-genes or full repertoires can be
		simulated. The algorithm begins with an initial VDJ
		recombination event, starting the first phylogenetic tree. Upon
		completion, the main loop of the algorithm begins, with each
		iteration representing one simulated time step. Various
		mutation events are possible at each time step, contributing to
		a diverse final repertoire.
