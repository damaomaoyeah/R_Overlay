		Finding Allele-Specific Copy Number in Next-Generation Sequencing
		Data // This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number
		Profiling using Next-Generation Sequencing.  Given the allele-
		specific coverage at the variant loci, this program segments
		the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific copy
		number.  It requires, as input, the read counts for each
		variant allele in a pair of case and control samples. For
		detection of somatic mutations, the case and control samples
		can be the tumor and normal sample from the same individual.
