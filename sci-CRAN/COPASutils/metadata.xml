		Tools for processing COPAS large-particle flow cytometer data //
		A logical workflow for the reading, processing, and
		visualization of data obtained from the Union Biometrica
		Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter (COPAS) platform
		large-particle flow cytometers and a powerful suite of
		functions for the rapid processing and analysis of large high-
		throughput screening data sets. It combines the speed of dplyr
		with the elegance of ggplot2 to make analysis of COPAS data
		fast and painless.
