		Developing a core collections // ccChooser can be used to
		developing and evaluation of core collections for germplasm
		collections (entire collection). This package used to develop a
		core collection for biological resources like genbanks. A core
		collection is defined as a sample of accessions that represent,
		with the lowest possible level of redundancy, the genetic
		diversity (the richness of gene or genotype categories) of the
		entire collection. The establishing a core collection that
		represents genetic diversity of the entire collection with
		minimum loss of its original diversity and minimum redundancies
		is an important problem for gene-banks curators and crop
		breeders. ccChooser establish core collection base on
		phenotypic data (agronomic, morphological, phenological).
