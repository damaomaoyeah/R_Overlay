		Statistical Tests for Cryptographic Randomness // Performs
		cryptographic randomness tests on a sequence of random integers
		or bits. Most of the included tests are not covered by standard
		test suites. In addition to the chi-square goodness-of-fit
		test, results of Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and
		Jarque-Bera tests are also generated by some of the
		cryptographic randomness tests. Additionally, it includes two
		functions for the calculation of greatest common divisor and
		the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
