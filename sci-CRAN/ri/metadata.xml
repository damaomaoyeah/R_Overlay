		ri: R package for performing randomization-based inference for
		experiments // This package provides a set of tools for
		conducting exact or approximate randomization-based inference
		for experiments of arbitrary design. The primary functionality
		of the package is in the generation, manipulation and use of
		permutation matrices implied by given experimental designs.
		Among other features, the package facilitates estimation of
		average treatment effects, constant effects variance
		estimation, randomization inference for significance testing
		against sharp null hypotheses and visualization of data and
		results.
