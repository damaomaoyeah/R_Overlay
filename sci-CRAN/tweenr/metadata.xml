		Interpolate Data for Smooth Animations // In order to create
		smooth animation between states of data, tweening is necessary.
		This package provides a range of functions for creating tweened
		data that plugs right into functions such as gg_animate() from
		the 'gganimate' package. Furthermore it adds a number of
		vectorized interpolaters for common R data types such as
		numeric, date and colour.
