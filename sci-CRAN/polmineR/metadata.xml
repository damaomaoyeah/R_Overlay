		Toolkit for Corpus Analysis // Tools for corpus analysis using
		the CWB as an efficient backend for indexing and querying large
		corpora. The package offers functionality to flexibly create
		subcorpora ("partitions") and to carry out basic statistical
		operations (count, cooccurrences etc.). The original full text
		of documents can be reconstructed and inspected at any time.
		Beyond that, the package is intended to serve as an interface
		to packages implementing advanced statistical procedures.
		Respective data structures (document term matrices, term
		cooccurrence matrices etc.) can be created based on the indexed
		corpora.
