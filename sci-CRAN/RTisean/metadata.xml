		R interface to Tisean algorithms // Algorithms for time series
		analysis from nonlinear dynamical systems theory originally
		made available by Rainer Hegger, Holger Kantz and Thomas
		Schreiber at the site http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean/
		.  A related R package (tseriesChaos by Antonio, Fabio Di
		Narzo) contains rewritten versions of a few of the TISEAN
		algorithms.   The intention of the present package is to use
		the TISEAN routines from within R with no need of manual
		importing/exporting.  It is in a beta version state, though
		most of the functions should be usable.  Correspondence should
		be sent to either Marji Lines, lines@dss.uniud.it, or to the
		current maintainer of the package. This package only contains R
		interface code. It requires that you have the Tisean-3.0.1
		algorithms available on your computer.
