		Assemble Data Frames from HTML Tables // htmltab is a package for
		extracting structured information from HTML tables. It is
		similar to readHTMLTable() of the XML package but provides two
		major advantages. First, the package automatically expands row
		and column spans in the header and body cells. Second, users
		are given more control over the identification of header and
		body rows which will end up in the R table. Additionally, the
		function preprocesses table code, removes unneeded parts and so
		helps to alleviate the need for tedious post-processing.
