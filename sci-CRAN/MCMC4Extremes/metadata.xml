		Posterior Distribution of Extreme Value Models in R // Provides
		some function to perform posterior estimation for some
		distribution, with emphasis to extreme value distributions. It
		contains some extreme datasets, and functions that perform the
		runs of posterior points of the GPD and GEV distribution. The
		package calculate some important extreme measures like return
		level for each t periods of time, and some plots as the
		predictive distribution, and return level plots.
