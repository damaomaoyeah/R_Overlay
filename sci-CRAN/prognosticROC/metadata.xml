		Prognostic ROC curves for evaluating the predictive capacity of a
		binary test // Prognostic ROC curve is an alternative graphical
		approach to represent the discriminative capacity of the
		marker: a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve by
		plotting 1 minus the survival in the high-risk group against 1
		minus the survival in the low-risk group. This package contains
		functions to assess prognostic ROC curve. The user can enter
		the survival according to a model previously estimated or the
		user can also enter individual survival data for estimating the
		prognostic ROC curve by using Kaplan-Meier estimator. The area
		under the curve (AUC) corresponds to the probability that a
		patient in the low-risk group has a longer lifetime than a
		patient in the high-risk group. The prognostic ROC curve
		provides complementary information compared to survival curves.
		The AUC is assessed by using the trapezoidal rules. When
		survival curves do not reach 0, the prognostic ROC curve is
		incomplete and the extrapolations of the AUC are performed by
		assuming pessimist, optimist and non-informative situations.
