		Spatial Stochastic Frontier Analysis // Spatial Stochastic
		Frontier Analysis (SSFA) is an original method for controlling
		the spatial heterogeneity in Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA)
		models, for cross-sectional data, by splitting the inefficiency
		term into three terms: the first one related to spatial
		peculiarities of the territory in which each single unit
		operates, the second one related to the specific production
		features and the third one representing the error term.
