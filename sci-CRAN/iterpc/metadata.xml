		Efficient Iterator for Permutations and Combinations // It helps
		in 1) generating permutations and combinations with or without
		replacement; 2) with distinct items or non-distinct items
		(multiset); 3) calculating number of combinations or
		permutations in various situations. All generated sequences are
		in lexicographical order (AKA, dictionary order). The
		algorithms to generate permutations and combinations are memory
		efficient. These iterative algorithms enable users to process
		all sequences without putting all results in the memory at the
		same time. The algorithms are written in C/C++ for faster
		performances.
