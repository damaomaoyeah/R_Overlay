		Manage tick-by-tick transaction data // TAQMNGR manages tick-by-
		tick transaction data, performing 'cleaning', 'aggregation' and
		'import' in an efficient and fast way (the package engine is
		developed in C++). Cleaning and Aggregation are performed
		according to Brownlees and Gallo (2006). Currently, TAQMNGR
		processes raw data from WRDS (Wharton Research Data Service).
