		Bayesian Spectral Inference for Stationary Time Series //
		Implementations of a Bayesian parametric (autoregressive), a
		Bayesian nonparametric (Whittle likelihood with Bernstein-
		Dirichlet prior) and a Bayesian semiparametric (autoregressive
		likelihood with Bernstein-Dirichlet correction) procedure are
		provided. The work is based on the corrected parametric
		likelihood by C. Kirch et al (2017) arXiv:1701.04846. It was
		supported by DFG grant KI 1443/3-1.
