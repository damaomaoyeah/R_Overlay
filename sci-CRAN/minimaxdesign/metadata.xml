		Minimax and Minimax Projection Designs // The 'minimaxdesign'
		package provides two main functions: mMcPSO() and miniMaxPro(),
		which generates minimax designs and minimax projection designs
		using clustering and particle swarm optimization (PSO)
		techniques. These designs can be used in a variety of settings,
		e.g., as space-filling designs for computer experiments or
		sensor allocation designs. A detailed description of the two
		designs and the employed algorithms can be found in Mak and
		Joseph (2016).
