		A genetic-based assay for the identification of cell lines // The
		SNP Panel Identification Assay (SPIA) is a package that enables
		an accurate determination of cell line identity from the
		genotype of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SPIA
		test allows to discern when two cell lines are close enough to
		be called similar and when they are not.
