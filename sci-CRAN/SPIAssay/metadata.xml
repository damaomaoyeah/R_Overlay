		A Genetic-Based Assay for the Identification of Cell Lines // The
		SNP Panel Identification Assay (SPIA) is a package that enables
		an accurate determination of cell line identity from the
		genotype of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The SPIA
		test allows to discern when two cell lines are close enough to
		be called similar and when they are not. Details about the
		method are available at "Demichelis et al. (2008) SNP panel
		identification assay (SPIA): a genetic-based assay for the
		identification of cell lines. Nucleic Acids Res., 3,
		2446-2456".
