		LaTeX Wrappers for R Users // Provides the functionality to write
		LaTeX code from within R without having to learn LaTeX.
		Functionality also exists to create HTML and Markdown code.
		While the functionality still exists to write complete
		documents with lazyWeave, it is generally easier to do so with
		with markdown and knitr.  lazyWeave's main strength now is the
		ability to design custom and complex tables for reporting
		results.
