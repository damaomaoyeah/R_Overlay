		Detecting Epistatic Selection with Partially Observed Genotype
		Data // An efficient multi-core package to reconstruct an
		underlying network of genomic signatures of high-dimensional
		epistatic selection from partially observed genotype data. The
		phenotype that we consider is viability. The network captures
		the conditional dependent short- and long-range linkage
		disequilibrium structure of genomes and thus reveals aberrant
		marker-marker associations that are due to epistatic selection.
		We target on high-dimensional genotype data where number of
		variables (markers) is larger than number of sample sizes (p
		n). The computations is memory-optimized using the sparse
		matrix output.
