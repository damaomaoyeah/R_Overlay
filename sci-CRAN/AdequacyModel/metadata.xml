		Adequacy of Probabilistic Models and General Purpose Optimization
		// The main application concerns to a new robust optimization
		package with two major contributions. The first contribution
		refers to the assessment of the adequacy of probabilistic
		models through a combination of several statistics, which
		measure the relative quality of statistical models for a given
		data set. The second one provides a general purpose
		optimization method based on meta-heuristics functions for
		maximizing or minimizing an arbitrary objective function.
