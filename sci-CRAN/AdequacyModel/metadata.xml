		Adequacy of probabilistic models and generation of pseudo-random
		numbers. // This package provides some useful functions for
		calculating quality measures for adjustment, including
		statistics Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-
		Darling. These statistics are often used to compare models not
		equipped. Also provided are other measures of fitness, such as
		AIC, CAIC, BIC and HQIC. The package also provides functions
		for generating pseudo-random number of random variables that
		follow the following probability distributions: Kumaraswamy
		Birnbaum-Saunders, Kumaraswamy Pareto, Exponentiated Weibull
		and Kumaraswamy Weibull.
