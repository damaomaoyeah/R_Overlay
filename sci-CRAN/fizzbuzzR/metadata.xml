		Fizz Buzz Implementation // An implementation of the Fizz Buzz
		algorithm, as defined e.g. in
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz. It provides the
		standard algorithm with 3 replaced by Fizz and 5 replaced by
		Buzz, with the option of specifying start and end numbers, step
		size and the numbers being replaced by fizz and buzz,
		respectively. This package gives interviewers the optional
		answer of "I use fizzbuzzR::fizzbuzz()" when interviewing
		rather than having to write an algorithm themselves.
