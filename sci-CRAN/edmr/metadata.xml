		Empirical differentially methylated regions calculation //
		Optimized DMR analysis based on bimodal normal distribution
		model and cost function for regional methylation analysis
		optimization. It captures the regional methylation modification
		by taking the spatial distribution of CpGs into account for the
		enrichment DNA methylation sequencing data so as to optimize
		the definition of the empirical regions. Combined with the
		dependent adjustment for regional p-value combination and DMR
		annotation.
