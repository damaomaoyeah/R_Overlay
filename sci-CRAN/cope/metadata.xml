		Coverage Probability Excursion (CoPE) Sets // Provides functions
		to  compute and plot Coverage Probability Excursion (CoPE) sets
		for real valued functions on a 2-dimensional domain. CoPE sets
		are obtained from repeated noisy observations of the function
		on the entire domain. They are designed to bound the excursion
		set of the target function at a given level from above and
		below with a predefined probability. The target function can be
		a parameter in spatially-indexed linear regression. Support by
		NIH grant R01 CA157528 is gratefully acknowledged.
