		Translates information from netcdf files with MC2 output into
		inter-PVT transitions. // Post processes MC2 output, especially
		for use by Path or ST-Sim.  MC2 (short for "MC1 version 2") is
		a dynamic global vegetation model (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGVM).
		Path (essa.com/tools/path) and ST-Sim (www.apexrms.com) are
		state-and-transition model (STM) engines. MC2 has a user
		website at sites.google.com/site/mc1dgvmusers.  Since 2001, MC1
		has been used to simulate changes in natural vegetation due to
		climate change at scales from regional to global.  In 2012, MC1
		was reimplemented in C++ to make it faster and to reduce
		storage requirements.  This newer version is referred to as
		MC2, an abbreviation of "MC1 version 2".  Beginning in 2011,
		output from MC1 and MC2 has been used to inform regional state-
		and-transition model simulations by the U.S. Forest Service and
		the Washington State Department of Natural Resources.  Projects
		to date have involved study areas in central Oregon, the
		Olympic Peninsula, the Blue Mountains ecoregion, southwestern
		Oregon, and southeastern Oregon.  In the first of this series
		of projects, the netCDF output files from MC2 were manually
		post-processed, mostly in Excel, to produce input .csv files
		for the STM engines. Beginning with the second project, R
		scripts were used to automate the post-processing work.  These
		R scripts have been collected into the MC2toPath R-package.
