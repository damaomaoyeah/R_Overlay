		Jack-Knife Support for Evolutionary Distinctiveness Indices I and
		W // These functions calculate the taxonomic measures presented
		in Miranda-Esquivel (2016). The package introduces Jack-knife
		resampling in evolutionary distinctiveness prioritization
		analysis, as a way to evaluate the support of the ranking in
		area prioritization, and the persistence of a given area in a
		conservation analysis. The algorithm is described in: Miranda-
		Esquivel, D (2016) DOI:10.1007/978-3-319-22461-9_11.
