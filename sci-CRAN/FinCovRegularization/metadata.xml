		Covariance Matrix Estimation and Regularization for Finance //
		Estimation and regularization for covariance matrix of asset
		returns. For covariance matrix estimation, three major types of
		factor models are included: macroeconomic factor model,
		fundamental factor model and statistical factor model. For
		covariance matrix regularization, four regularized estimators
		are included: banding, tapering, hard-thresholding and soft-
		thresholding. The tuning parameters of these regularized
		estimators are selected via cross-validation.
