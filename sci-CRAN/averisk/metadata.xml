		Calculation of Average Population Attributable Fractions and
		Confidence Intervals // Average population attributable
		fractions are calculated for a set of risk factors (either
		binary or ordinal valued) for both prospective and case-
		control designs. Confidence intervals are found by Monte Carlo
		simulation. The method can be applied to either prospective or
		case control designs, provided an estimate of disease
		prevalence is provided. In addition to an exact calculation of
		AF, an approximate calculation, based on randomly sampling
		permutations has been implemented to ensure the calculation is
		computationally tractable when the number of risk factors is
		large.
