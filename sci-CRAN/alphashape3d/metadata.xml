		Implementation of the 3D alpha-shape for the reconstruction of 3D
		sets from a point cloud // The package alphashape3d presents
		the implementation in R of the alpha-shape of a finite set of
		points in the three-dimensional space. This geometric structure
		generalizes the convex hull and allows to recover the shape of
		non-convex and even non-connected sets in 3D, given a random
		sample of points taken into it. Besides the computation of the
		alpha-shape, the package alphashape3d provides users with
		functions to compute the volume of the alpha-shape, identify
		the connected components and facilitate the three-dimensional
		graphical visualization of the estimated set.
