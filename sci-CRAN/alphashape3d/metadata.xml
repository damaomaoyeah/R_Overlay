		Implementation of the 3D Alpha-Shape for the Reconstruction of 3D
		Sets from a Point Cloud // Implementation in R of the alpha-
		shape of a finite set of points in the three-dimensional space.
		The alpha-shape generalizes the convex hull and allows to
		recover the shape of non-convex and even non-connected sets in
		3D, given a random sample of points taken into it. Besides the
		computation of the alpha-shape, this package provides users
		with functions to compute the volume of the alpha-shape,
		identify the connected components and facilitate the three-
		dimensional graphical visualization of the estimated set.
