		An R client for interacting with the White House's "We The
		People" petition API. // Implements an R client for the We The
		People petitions API. The client supports loading petitions,
		signatures, and users. Additionally, the package includes
		petition and signature data samples. There are also several
		functions for analyzing and visualizing the data. Term
		frequency calculations and word clouds are supported using the
		tm and wordcloud package, respectively. Petition and issue
		summary plots are also implemented using the ggplot2 package.
		For additional information about the We The People project, see
		https://petitions.whitehouse.gov. Note that the API limits
		requests to 10/second. For bulk data loading, please use the
		data dump provided by the White House:
