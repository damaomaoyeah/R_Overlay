		Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS)
		// Alternating least squares is often used to resolve
		components contributing to data with a bilinear structure; the
		basic technique may be extended to alternating constrained
		least squares.  Commonly applied constraints include
		unimodality, non-negativity, and normalization of components.
		Several data matrices may be decomposed simultaneously by
		assuming that one of the two matrices in the bilinear
		decomposition is shared between datasets.
