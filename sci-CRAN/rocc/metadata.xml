		ROC based classification // Functions for a classification method
		based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC). Briefly,
		features are selected according to their ranked AUC value in
		the training set. The selected features are merged by the mean
		value to form a metagene. The samples are ranked by their
		metagene value and the metagene threshold that has the highest
		accuracy in splitting the training samples is determined. A new
		sample is classified by its metagene value relative to the
		threshold. In the first place, the package is aimed at two
		class problems in gene expression data, but might also apply to
		other problems.
