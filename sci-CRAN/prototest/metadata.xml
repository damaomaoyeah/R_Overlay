		Inference on Prototypes from Clusters of Features // Procedures
		for testing for group-wide signal in clusters of variables.
		Tests can be performed for single groups in isolation
		(univariate) or multiple groups together (multivariate).
		Specific tests include the exact and approximate (un)selective
		likelihood ratio tests described in Reid et al (2015), the
		selective F test and marginal screening prototype test of Reid
		and Tibshirani (2015). User may pre-specify columns to be
		included in prototype formation, or allow the function to
		select them itself. A mixture of these two is also possible.
		Any variable selection is accounted for using the selective
		inference framework. Options for non-sampling and hit-and-run
		null reference distributions.
