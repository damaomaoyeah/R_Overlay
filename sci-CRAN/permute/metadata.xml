		Functions for Generating Restricted Permutations of Data // A set
		of restricted permutation designs for freely exchangeable, line
		transects (time series), and spatial grid designs plus
		permutation of blocks (groups of samples) is provided.
		'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which the whole-
		plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeable or one
		of the restricted designs. The 'permute' package is modelled
		after the permutation schemes of 'Canoco 3.1' (and later) by
		Cajo ter Braak.
