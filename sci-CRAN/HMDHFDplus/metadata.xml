		from the Human Mortality Database (www.mortality.org), Human
		Fertility Database (www.humanfertility.org), and similar
		databases from the web or locally into an R session as
		data.frame objects. These are the two most widely used sources
		of demographic data to study basic demographic change, trends,
		and develop new demographic methods. Other supported databases
		at this time include the Human Fertility Collection
		(http://www.fertilitydata.org/), The Japanese Mortality
		Database (http://www.ipss.go.jp/p-toukei/JMD), and the Canadian
		Human Mortality Database (http://www.bdlc.umontreal.ca/chmd/).
