		Estimation and Testing of Average Hazard Ratios // Methods for
		estimation of multivariate average hazard ratios as defined by
		Kalbfleisch and Prentice. The underlying survival functions of
		the event of interest in each group can be estimated using
		either the (weighted) Kaplan-Meier estimator or the Aalen-
		Johansen estimator for the transition probabilities in Markov
		multi-state models. Right-censored and left-truncated data is
		supported. Moreover, the difference in restricted mean survival
		can be estimated.
