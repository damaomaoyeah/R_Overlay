		Compare Timing of Network Visualizations // We provide two
		primary resources in 'ggCompNet'. The first is a function to
		compare the speed of network drawing using several different
		packages. The second is the vignette folder which contains two
		vignettes that provide code for reproducing examples comparing
		the three network visualization packages 'geomnet',
		'ggnetwork', and the ggnet2() function from the 'GGally'
		package.
