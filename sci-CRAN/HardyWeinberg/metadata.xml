		Statistical Tests and Graphics for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium //
		Contains tools for exploring Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for
		diallelic genetic marker data. All classical tests (chi-square,
		exact, likelihood-ratio and permutation tests) for Hardy-
		Weinberg equilibrium are included in the package, as well as
		functions for power computation and for the simulation of
		marker data under equilibrium and disequilibrium. Routines for
		dealing with markers on the X-chromosome are included.
		Functions for testing equilibrium in the presence of missing
		data by using multiple imputation are also provided. Implements
		several graphics for exploring the equilibrium status of a
		large set of diallelic markers: ternary plots with acceptance
		regions, log-ratio plots and Q-Q plots.
