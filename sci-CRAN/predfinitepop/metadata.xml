		Predictive Inference on Totals and Averages of Finite Populations
		Segmented in Planned and Unplanned Domains. // This package
		computes Bayesian predictive inference on totals and averages
		of finite populations segmented in planned and unplanned
		domains. Inference is based on Bayesian nonparametric methods
		using species-sampling models (specifically the Dirichlet
		process).
