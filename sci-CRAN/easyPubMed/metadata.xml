		Searching and Retrieving Scientific Publication Data from PubMed
		// It is a tool that makes querying and downloading data from
		PubMed easy. It offers a simple-to-use interface for the PubMed
		API. It is suitable for downloading large number of records
		from PubMed. It queries the Entrez Database via the
		getPubmedIds() function. It also retrieves XML data from Pubmed
		via the fetchPubmedData() function. XML data are retrieved on
		the fly, therefore no files are saved on the local machine by
		default. More info are available at the following URL
