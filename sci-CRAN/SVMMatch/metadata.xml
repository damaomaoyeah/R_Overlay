		Causal Effect Estimation and Diagnostics with Support Vector
		Machines // Causal effect estimation in observational data
		often requires identifying a set of untreated observations that
		are comparable to some treated group of interest.  This package
		provides a suite of functions for identifying such a set of
		observations and for implementing standard and new diagnostics
		tools.  The primary function, svmmatch(), uses support vector
		machines to identify a region of common support between
		treatment and control groups.  A sensitivity analysis, balance
		checking, and assessment of the region of overlap between
		treated and control groups is included.  The Bayesian
		implementation allows for recovery of uncertainty estimates for
		the treatment effect and all other parameters.
