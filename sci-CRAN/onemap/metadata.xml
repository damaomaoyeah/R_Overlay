		Software for constructing genetic maps in experimental crosses:
		full-sib, RILs, F2 and backcrosses // Analysis of molecular
		marker data from model (backcrosses, F2 and recombinant inbred
		lines) and non-model systems (i. e. outcrossing species). For
		the later, it allows statistical analysis by simultaneously
		estimating linkage and linkage phases (genetic map
		construction). All analysis are based on multipoint approaches
		using hidden Markov models.
