		Tools to Support Optimization Methods // Tools to assist in
		safely applying user-generated objective and derivative
		functions to optimization programs. "Optimization" at the time
		of writing refers primarily to function minimization methods
		with at most bounds and masks on the parameters. Tools are
		provided to check the basic computation of objective functions
		that the user provides, along with proposed gradient and
		Hessian functions, as well as to wrap such functions to avoid
		failures when inadmissible parameters are provided. Checks on
		bounds and masks (fixed parameters) are available, as are a
		check on scaling or optimality conditions. An axial search to
		seek lower points on the objective function surface is
		included. Though numDeriv is used as the primary tool for
		numerical derivative approximations, forward, central and
		backward gradient approximation codes for convenience.
