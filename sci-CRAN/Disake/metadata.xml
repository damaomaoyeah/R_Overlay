		Discrete associated kernel estimators // Discrete smoothing of
		probability mass function is performed using three discrete
		associated kernels: Dirac Discrete Uniform (DiracDU), Binomial
		and Discrete Triangular. Two automatic bandwidth selection
		procedures are implemented: the cross-validation method for the
		three kernels and the local Bayesian approach for Binomial
		kernel. Note that DiracDU is used for categorical data,
		Binomial kernel is appropriate for count data with small or
		moderate sample sizes, and Discrete Triangular kernel is
		recommended for count data with large sample sizes.
