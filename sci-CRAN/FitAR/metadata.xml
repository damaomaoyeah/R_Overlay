		Subset AR Model Fitting // Comprehensive model building function
		for identification, estimation and diagnostic checking for AR
		and subset AR models. Two types of subset AR models are
		supported.  One family of subset AR models, denoted by ARp, is
		formed by taking subet of the original AR coefficients and in
		the other, denoted by ARz, subsets of the partial
		autocorrelations are used. The main advantage of the ARz model
		is its applicability to very large order models.
