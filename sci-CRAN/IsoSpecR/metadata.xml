		An R Interface to the IsoSpec Algorithm // IsoSpec is a fine
		structure calculator used for obtaining the most probable
		masses of a chemical compound given the frequencies of the
		composing isotopes and their masses. It finds the smallest set
		of isotopologues with a given probability. The probability is
		assumed to be that of the product of multinomial distributions,
		each corresponding to one particular element and parametrized
		by the frequencies of finding these elements in nature. These
		numbers are supplied by IUPAC - the International Union of Pure
		and Applied Chemistry.
