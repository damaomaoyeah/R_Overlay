		Variance Dispersion Graphs and Fraction of Design Space Plots //
		Facilities for constructing variance dispersion graphs,
		fraction-of-design-space plots and similar graphics for
		exploring the properties of experimental designs. The design
		region is explored via random sampling, which allows for more
		flexibility than traditional variance dispersion graphs. A
		formula interface is leveraged to provide access to complex
		model formulae. Graphics can be constructed simultaneously for
		multiple experimental designs and/or multiple model formulae.
		Instead of using pointwise optimization to find the minimum and
		maximum scaled prediction variance curves, which can be
		inaccurate and time consuming, this package uses quantile
		regression as an alternative.
