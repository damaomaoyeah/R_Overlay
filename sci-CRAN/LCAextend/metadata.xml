		Latent Class Analysis (LCA) with familial dependence in extended
		pedigrees // This package performs a Latent Class Analysis of
		phenotypic measurements in pedigrees and a model selection
		based on one of two methods: likelihood-based cross-validation
		and Bayesian Information Criterion. It computes also individual
		and triplet child-parents weights in a pedigree using an
		upward-downward algorithm. It takes into account the familial
		dependence defined by the pedigree structure by considering
		that a class of a child depends on his parents classes via
		triplet-transition probabilities of the classes. The package
		handles the case where measurements are available on all
		subjects and the case where measurements are available only on
		symptomatic (i.e. affected) subjects. Distributions for
		discrete (or ordinal) and continuous data are currently
		implemented. The package can deal with missing data.
