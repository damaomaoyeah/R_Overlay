		Phylogenetic Assembly with Soft Taxonomic Inferences // A pre-
		processor for mrBayes that assimilates sequences, taxonomic
		information and tree constraints as per xxx.  The main
		functions of interest for most users will be pastis_simple,
		pastis_main and conch. The main analysis is conducted with
		pastis_simple or pastis_main followed by a manual execution of
		mrBayes (3.2). The placement of taxa not contained in the tree
		constraint can be investigated using conch.
