		Variational Bayesian Inference for Genome-Wide Regression //
		Conducts linear regression using variational Bayesian
		inference, particularly optimized for genome-wide association
		mapping and whole-genome prediction which use a number of DNA
		markers as the explanatory variables. Provides seven regression
		models which select the important variables (i.e., the
		variables related to response variables) among the given
		explanatory variables in different ways (i.e., model
		structures).
