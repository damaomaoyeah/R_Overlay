		Extreme Machine Learning (ELM) // Training and prediction
		functions are provided for the Extreme Learning Machine
		algorithm (ELM). The ELM use a Single Hidden Layer Feedforward
		Neural Network (SLFN) with random generated weights and no
		gradient-based backpropagation. The training time is very short
		and the online version allows to update the model using small
		chunk of the training set at each iteration. The only parameter
		to tune is the hidden layer size and the learning function.
