		Quantitative Analysis Made Accessible // Contains a number of
		functions that serve two goals: first, make R more accessible
		to people migrating from SPSS by adding a number of functions
		that behave roughly like their SPSS equivalents; and second,
		make a number of slightly more advanced functions more user
		friendly to relatively novice users.
