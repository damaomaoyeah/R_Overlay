		Fitting Semi-Parametric log-Symmetric Regression Models // Set of
		tools to fit a semi-parametric regression model suitable for
		analysis of data sets in which the response variable is
		continuous, strictly positive, asymmetric and possibly,
		censored. Under this setup, both the median and the skewness of
		the response variable distribution are explicitly modeled by
		using semi-parametric functions, whose non-parametric
		components may be approximated by natural cubic splines or
		P-splines. Supported distributions for the model error include
		log-normal, log-Student-t, log-power-exponential, log-
		hyperbolic, log-contaminated-normal, log-slash, Birnbaum-
		Saunders and Birnbaum-Saunders-t distributions.
