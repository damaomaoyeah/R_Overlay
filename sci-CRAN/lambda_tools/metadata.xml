		Tools for Modeling Data with Functional Programming // Provides
		tools that manipulate and transform data using methods and
		techniques consistent with functional programming. The idea is
		that through the use of these tools, a program can be reasoned
		about insomuch that the implementation can be proven to be
		equivalent to the mathematical model.
