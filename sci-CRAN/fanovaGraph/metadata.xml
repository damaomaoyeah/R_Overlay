		Building Kriging Models from FANOVA Graphs // Estimation and
		plotting of a function's FANOVA graph to identify the
		interaction structure and fitting, prediction and simulation of
		a Kriging model modified by the identified structure. The
		interactive function plotManipulate() can only be run on the
		RStudio IDE with RStudio's package 'manipulate' loaded. RStudio
		is freely available (www.rstudio.org), and includes package
		'manipulate'. The equivalent function plotTk() bases on CRAN
		Repository packages only.
