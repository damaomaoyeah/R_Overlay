		Statistical Methods for Trapezoidal Fuzzy Numbers // The aim of
		the package is to provide some basic functions for doing
		statistics with trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In particular, the
		package contains several functions for simulating trapezoidal
		fuzzy numbers, as well as for calculating some central tendency
		measures (mean and two types of median), some scale measures
		(variance, ADD, MDD, Sn, Qn, Tn and some M-estimators) and one
		diversity index and one inequality index. Moreover, functions
		for calculating the 1-norm distance, the mid/spr distance and
		the (phi,theta)-wabl/ldev/rdev distance between fuzzy numbers
		are included, and a function to calculate the value phi-wabl
		given a sample of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.
