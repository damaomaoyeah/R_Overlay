		Functions to fit cell volume distributions and thereby estimate
		cell growth rates and division times // This package implements
		a methodology for using cell volume distributions to estimate
		cell growth rates and division times that is described in the
		paper entitled "Cell Volume Distributions Reveal Cell Growth
		Rates and Division Times", by Michael Halter, John T. Elliott,
		Joseph B. Hubbard, Alessandro Tona and Anne L. Plant, which is
		in press in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.  In order to
		reproduce the analysis used to obtain Table 1 in the paper,
		execute the command "example(fitVolDist)".
