		Kernelized Stein Discrepancy // An adaptation of Kernelized Stein
		Discrepancy, a discrepancy statistic for measuring differences
		between two probability distributions based on combination of
		Stein's method and reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory. It
		provides a method for a user to evaluate how similar two
		distributions are. It is based on "A Kernelized Stein
		Discrepancy for Goodness-of-fit Tests and Model Evaluation" by
		Liu, Lee, and Jordan, available at
		http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03253.
