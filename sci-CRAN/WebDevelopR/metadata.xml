		Website development package for R // Two versions of the package
		are available.  One provides only the basic script required to
		facilitate communication between a site user's web browser and
		an R script.  The other consists of a basic web application
		with a form for the site user to choose options for the
		analysis and a results page showing the results of the
		analysis.  The package can be viewed as an extension of
		CGIwithR, fixing a few technical problems associated with large
		data files and long computations, addressing some security
		issues, allowing the web programmer to choose the data
		interchange format to be used in communications between the
		server and the browser, and providing a template website to
		reduce the programming burden on the user.
