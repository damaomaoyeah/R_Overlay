		Metaheuristic Optimization Framework for Preprocessing
		Combinations // Automation of preprocessing often requires
		computationally costly preprocessing combinations. This package
		helps to find near-best combinations faster. Sub heuristics
		supported are random and grid restarts, taboo list, decreasing
		probability for accepting inferior solutions and location of
		previously best solution candidate is compared to. The package
		is intended to be used with package 'preprocomb' and takes its
		'GridClass' object as input.
