		Metaheuristic Optimization Framework for Preprocessing
		Combinations // Automation of preprocessing often requires
		computationally costly preprocessing combinations. This package
		helps to find near-best combinations faster. Metaheuristics
		supported are taboo search, simulated annealing, reheating and
		late acceptance. Start conditions include random and grid
		starts. End conditions include all iteration rounds completed,
		objective threshold reached and convergence. Metaheuristics,
		start and end conditions can be hybridized and hyperparameters
		optimized. Parallel computations are supported. The package is
		intended to be used with package 'preprocomb' and takes its
		'GridClass' object as input.
