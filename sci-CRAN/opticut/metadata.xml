		Likelihood Based Optimal Partitioning for Indicator Species
		Analysis // Likelihood based optimal partitioning for indicator
		species analysis. Finding the best binary partition for each
		species based on model selection, possibly controlling for
		modifying/confounding variables as described in Kemencei et al.
		(2014) doi:10.1556/ComEc.15.2014.2.6. The package also
		implements various measures of uncertainty based on binary
		partitions, optimal multinomial partitioning, and exploratory
		suitability indices, with native support for parallel
		computations.
