		Tools to Support the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF) //
		Implements various methods for eliciting a probability
		distribution for a single parameter from an expert or a group
		of experts. The expert provides a small number of probability
		judgements, corresponding to points on his or her cumulative
		distribution function. A range of parametric distributions can
		then be fitted and displayed, with feedback provided in the
		form of fitted probabilities and percentiles. A graphical
		interface for the roulette elicitation method is also provided.
		For multiple experts, a weighted linear pool can be calculated.
		Also includes functions for eliciting beliefs about population
		distributions.
