		BayesValidate Package // BayesValidate implements the software
		validation method described in the paper "Validation of
		Software for Bayesian Models using Posterior Quantiles" (Cook,
		Gelman, and Rubin, 2005).  It inputs a function to perform
		Bayesian inference as well as functions to generate data from
		the Bayesian model being fit, and repeatedly generates and
		analyzes data to check that the Bayesian inference program
		works properly.
