		Develop and Run Spatially Explicit Discrete Event Simulation
		Models // Implement a variety of event-based models, with a
		focus on spatially explicit models. These include raster-based,
		event-based, and agent-based models. The core simulation
		components are built upon a discrete event simulation (DES)
		framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the
		user to include additional functionality by running user-built
		simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to visualize
		raster and other maps. The suggested package 'fastshp' can be
		installed with `install.packages("fastshp", repos =
		"http://rforge.net", type = "source")`.
