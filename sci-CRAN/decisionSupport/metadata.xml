		Quantitative Support of Decision Making under Uncertainty //
		Supporting the quantitative analysis of binary welfare based
		decision making processes using Monte Carlo simulations.
		Decision support is given on two levels: (i) The actual
		decision level is to choose between two alternatives under
		probabilistic uncertainty. This package calculates the optimal
		decision based on maximizing expected welfare. (ii) The meta
		decision level is to allocate resources to reduce the
		uncertainty in the underlying decision problem, i.e to increase
		the current information to improve the actual decision making
		process. This problem is dealt with using the Value of
		Information Analysis. The Expected Value of Information for
		arbitrary prospective estimates can be calculated as well as
		Individual and Clustered Expected Value of Perfect Information.
		The probabilistic calculations are done via Monte Carlo
		simulations. This Monte Carlo functionality can be used on its
		own.
