		Outlier Detection Algorithms for High-Dimensional Data // Three
		high-dimensional outlier detection algorithms and a outlier
		unification scheme are implemented in this package. The angle-
		based outlier detection (ABOD) algorithm is based on the work
		of Kriegel, Schubert, and Zimek [2008]. The subspace outlier
		detection (SOD) algorithm is based on the work of Kriegel,
		Kroger, Schubert, and Zimek [2009]. The feature bagging-based
		outlier detection (FBOD) algorithm is based on the work of
		Lazarevic and Kumar [2005]. The outlier unification scheme is
		based on the work of Kriegel, Kroger, Schubert, and Zimek
		[2011].
