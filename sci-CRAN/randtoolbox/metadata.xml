		Toolbox for Pseudo and Quasi Random Number Generation and RNG
		Tests. // The package provides (1) pseudo random generators -
		general linear congruential generators (Park Miller) and
		multiple recursive generators (Knuth TAOCP), generalized
		feedback shift register (SF-Mersenne Twister algorithm and WELL
		generators); (2) quasi random generators - the Torus algorithm,
		the Sobol sequence, the Halton sequence (thus include Van der
		Corput sequence) and (3) some additional tests such as the gap
		test, the serial test, the poker test... The package depends on
		rngWELL package but it can be provided without this dependency
		on demand to the maintainer. For true random number generation,
		use the 'random' package, for Latin Hypercube Sampling (a
		hybrid QMC method), use the 'lhs' package, a number of RNGs and
		tests for RNGs are provided by 'RDieHarder', all available on
		CRAN. There is also a small stand-alone package 'rngwell19937'
		for the WELL19937a RNG.
