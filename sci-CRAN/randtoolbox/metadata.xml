		Toolbox for Pseudo and Quasi Random Number Generation and RNG
		Tests // Provides (1) pseudo random generators - general linear
		congruential generators, multiple recursive generators and
		generalized feedback shift register (SF-Mersenne Twister
		algorithm and WELL generators); (2) quasi random generators -
		the Torus algorithm, the Sobol sequence, the Halton sequence
		(including the Van der Corput sequence) and (3) some RNG tests
		- the gap test, the serial test, the poker test. The package
		depends on rngWELL package but it can be provided without this
		dependency on demand to the maintainer. For true random number
		generation, use the 'random' package, for Latin Hypercube
		Sampling (a hybrid QMC method), use the 'lhs' package. A number
		of RNGs and tests for RNGs are also provided by 'RDieHarder',
		all available on CRAN. There is also a small stand-alone
		package 'rngwell19937' for the WELL19937a RNG.
