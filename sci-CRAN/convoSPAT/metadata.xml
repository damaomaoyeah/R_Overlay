		Convolution-Based Nonstationary Spatial Modeling // Fits
		convolution-based nonstationary Gaussian process models to
		point-referenced spatial data. The nonstationary covariance
		function allows the user to specify the underlying correlation
		structure and which spatial dependence parameters should be
		allowed to vary over space: the anisotropy, nugget variance,
		and process variance. The parameters are estimated via maximum
		likelihood, using a local likelihood approach. Also provided
		are functions to fit stationary spatial models for comparison,
		calculate the Kriging predictor and standard errors, and create
		various plots to visualize nonstationarity.
