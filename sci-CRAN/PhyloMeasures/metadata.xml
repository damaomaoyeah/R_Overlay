		Fast and Exact Algorithms for Computing Phylogenetic Biodiversity
		Measures // Given a phylogenetic tree T and a sample S of
		species represented as a subset of tips in T, we want to
		compute a measure of the diversity of the species in S with
		respect to T. The current package offers the implementations of
		efficient algorithms for several such measures. Most
		importantly, the package includes algorithms for computing
		exactly and efficiently the expectation and the variance of
		these measures, which are essential for null model comparisons.
		Efficient computation of richness-standardized versions of
		these metrics, such as the net relatedness index (NRI), nearest
		taxon index (NTI), phylogenetic diversity index (PDI), and the
		corresponding indices of two-sample measures are also available
		in this package. The package also introduces a new single-
		sample measure, the Core Ancestor Cost (CAC); the package
		provides functions for computing the value and the standardised
		index of the CAC and, more than that, there is an extra
		function available that can compute exactly any statistical
		moment of the measure.
