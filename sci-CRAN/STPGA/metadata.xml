		Selection of Training Populations by Genetic Algorithm // Can be
		utilized to select a test data calibrated training population
		in high dimensional prediction problems and assumes that the
		explanatory variables are observed for all of the individuals.
		Once a "good" training set is identified, the response variable
		can be obtained only for this set to build a model for
		predicting the response in the test set.
