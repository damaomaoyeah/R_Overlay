		Joint Modelling of Mixed Correlated Binary and Continuous
		Responses : A Latent Variable Approach // A joint regression
		model for mixed correlated binary and continuous responses is
		presented. In this model binary response can be dependent on
		the continuous response. With this model, the dependence
		between responses can be taken into account by the correlation
		between errors in the models for binary and continuous
		responses.
