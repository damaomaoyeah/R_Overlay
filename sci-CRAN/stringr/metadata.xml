		Make it easier to work with strings. // stringr is a set of
		simple wrappers that make R's string functions more consistent,
		simpler and easier to use.  It does this by ensuring that:
		function and argument names (and positions) are consistent, all
		functions deal with NA's and zero length character
		appropriately, and the output data structures from each
		function matches the input data structures of other functions.
