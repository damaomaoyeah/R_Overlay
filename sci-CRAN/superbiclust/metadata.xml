		Generating Robust Biclusters from a Bicluster Set (Ensemble
		Biclustering) // Biclusters are submatrices in the data matrix
		which satisfy certain conditions of homogeneity. Package
		contains functions for generating robust biclusters with
		respect to the initialization parameters for a given bicluster
		solution contained in a bicluster set in data, the procedure is
		also known as ensemble biclustering. The set of biclusters is
		evaluated based on the similarity of its elements (the
		overlap), and afterwards the hierarchical tree is constructed
		to obtain cut-off points for the classes of robust biclusters.
		The result is a number of robust (or super) biclusters with
		none or low overlap.
