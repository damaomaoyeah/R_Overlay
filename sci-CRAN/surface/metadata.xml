		Fitting Hansen Models to Investigate Convergent Evolution //
		SURFACE is a data-driven phylogenetic comparative method for
		fitting stabilizing selection models to continuous trait data,
		building on the ouch package. The main functions fit a series
		of Hansen models using stepwise AIC, then identify cases of
		convergent evolution where multiple lineages have shifted to
		the same adaptive peak.
