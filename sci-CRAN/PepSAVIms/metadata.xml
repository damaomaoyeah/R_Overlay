		PepSAVI-MS Data Analysis // An implementation of the data
		processing and data analysis portion of a pipeline named the
		PepSAVI-MS which is currently under development by the Hicks
		laboratory at the University of North Carolina.  The
		statistical analysis package presented herein provides a
		collection of software tools used to facilitate the
		prioritization of putative bioactive peptides from a complex
		biological matrix.  Tools are provided to deconvolute mass
		spectrometry features into a single representation for each
		peptide charge state, filter compounds to include only those
		possibly contributing to the observed bioactivity, and
		prioritize these remaining compounds for those most likely
		contributing to each bioactivity data set.
