		A collection of functions for estimating centrographic statistics
		and computational geometries for spatial point patterns // A
		collection of functions for computing centrographic statistics
		(e.g., standard distance, standard deviation ellipse, standard
		deviation box) for observations taken at point locations.
		Separate plotting functions have been developed for each
		measure. Users interested in writing results to ESRI shapefiles
		can do so by using results from aspace functions as inputs to
		the convert.to.shapefile and write.shapefile functions in the
		shapefiles library. The aspace library was originally conceived
		to aid in the analysis of spatial patterns of travel behaviour
		(see Buliung and Remmel, 2008). Major changes in the current
		version include (1) removal of dependencies on several external
		libraries (e.g., gpclib, maptools, sp), (2) the separation of
		plotting and estimation capabilities, (3) reduction in the
		number of functions, and (4) expansion of analytical
		capabilities with additional functions for descriptive analysis
		and visualization (e.g., standard deviation box, centre of
		minimum distance, central feature).
