		R Package for Analyzing Endorsement Experiments // This R package
		implements the statistical model proposed by Bullock, Imai, and
		Shapiro (2011; Political Analysis) to analyze endorsement
		experiments.  Endorsement experiments are a survey methodology
		for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions.  This
		methodology is helpful when measuring support for socially
		sensitive political actors such as militant groups.  The model
		is fitted with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and
		produces the output containing draws from the posterior
		distribution.
