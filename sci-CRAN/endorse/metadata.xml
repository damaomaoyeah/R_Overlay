		Bayesian Measurement Models for Analyzing Endorsement Experiments
		// Fit the hierarchical and non-hierarchical Bayesian
		measurement models proposed by Bullock, Imai, and Shapiro
		(2011) DOI:10.1093/pan/mpr031 to analyze endorsement
		experiments.  Endorsement experiments are a survey methodology
		for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions.  This
		methodology is helpful when measuring support for socially
		sensitive political actors such as militant groups.  The model
		is fitted with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm and
		produces the output containing draws from the posterior
		distribution.
