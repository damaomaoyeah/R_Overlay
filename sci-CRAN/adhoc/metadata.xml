		calculate ad hoc distance thresholds for DNA barcoding
		identification // An ad hoc distance threshold can be
		calculated for each particular reference library of DNA
		barcodes. Specimen identification at this ad hoc distance
		threshold (using the best close match method) will produce
		identifications with an estimated relative error probability
		that can be fixed by the user (e.g. 5%)
