		Descriptive Analysis by Groups // Read, interpret, summarise,
		display and analyse epidemiological data. Can be used to create
		data summaries for quality control, extensive reports for
		exploring data, including publication-ready univariate or
		bivariate tables in plain text HTML and LaTeX, and a figures to
		quickly visualise the distribution of your data. Depending on
		the nature of the variable, various statistics are calculated
		(mean, median, frequencies, incidences) and appropriate tests
		are performed (t-test, Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis,
		Fisher, log-rank, ...). The latest version includes
		functionality for summarising genetic data, and for performing
		low-level quality control of your database (see radiograph())
		to help identify data-entry errors. This version has also been
		implemented in a web-interface to make this package accessible
		to non-R-users.
