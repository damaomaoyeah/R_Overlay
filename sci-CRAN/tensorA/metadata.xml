		Advanced tensors arithmetic with named indices // The package
		provides convenience functions for advance linear algebra with
		tensors and computation with datasets of tensors on a higher
		level abstraction. It includes Einstein and Riemann summing
		conventions, dragging, co- and contravariate indices, parallel
		computations on sequences of tensors.
