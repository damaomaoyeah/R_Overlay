		Geographically Weighted Fractal Analysis // Performs
		Geographically Weighted Fractal Analysis (GWFA) to calculate
		the local fractal dimension of a set of points. GWFA mixes the
		Sandbox multifractal algorithm and the Geographically Weighted
		Regression. Unlike fractal box-counting algorithm, the sandbox
		algorithm avoids border effects because the boxes are adjusted
		on the set of points. The Geographically Weighted approach
		consists in applying a kernel that describes the way the
		neighbourhood of each estimated point is taken into account to
		estimate its fractal dimension. GWFA can be used to
		discriminate built patterns of a city, a region, or a whole
		country.
