		Evaluate Counterfactuals // Inferences about counterfactuals are
		essential for prediction, answering what if questions, and
		estimating causal effects. However, when the counterfactuals
		posed are too far from the data at hand, conclusions drawn from
		well-specified statistical analyses become based largely on
		speculation hidden in convenient modeling assumptions that few
		would be willing to defend. Unfortunately, standard statistical
		approaches assume the veracity of the model rather than
		revealing the degree of model-dependence, which makes this
		problem hard to detect. WhatIf offers easy-to-apply methods to
		evaluate counterfactuals that do not require sensitivity
		testing over specified classes of models. If an analysis fails
		the tests offered here, then we know that substantive
		inferences will be sensitive to at least some modeling choices
		that are not based on empirical evidence, no matter what method
		of inference one chooses to use.
