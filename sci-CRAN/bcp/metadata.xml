		A Package for Performing a Bayesian Analysis of Change Point
		Problems // This package provides an implementation of an
		approximation to the Barry and Hartigan (1993) product
		partition model for the normal errors change point problem
		using Markov Chain Monte Carlo.  It also extends the
		methodology to independent multivariate series with an assumed
		common change point structure.
