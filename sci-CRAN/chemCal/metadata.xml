		Calibration functions for analytical chemistry // chemCal
		provides simple functions for plotting linear calibration
		functions and estimating standard errors for measurements
		according to the Handbook of Chemometrics and Qualimetrics:
		Part A by Massart et al. There are also functions estimating
		the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ).
		The functions work on model objects from - optionally weighted
		- linear regression (lm) or robust linear regression (rlm from
		the MASS package).
