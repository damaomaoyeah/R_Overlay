		Large Regressions // Uses gradient descent to minimize the sum of
		squared residuals for the regression problem.  Can include an
		L2 penalty on the coefficient matrix. This function is very
		useful when there is an initial guess of what B should be in Y
		= XB. In general, this function performs faster than R's lm
		function. GPU acceleration can be used to make this function
		extremely fast.  This package suggests cudaMatrixOps, which is
		not on CRAN but can be downloaded at stanford.edu/~jeffwong.
