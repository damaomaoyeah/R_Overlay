		Bias, Precision, and Power for Multi-Level Random Regressions //
		Calculates bias, precision, and power for multi-level random
		regressions. Random regressions are types of hierarchical
		models in which data are structured in groups and (regression)
		coefficients can vary by groups. Tools to estimate model
		performance are designed mostly for scenarios where
		(regression) coefficients vary at just one level. 'MultiRR'
		provides simulation and analytical tools (based on 'lme4') to
		study model performance for random regressions that vary at
		more than one level (multi-level random regressions), allowing
		researchers to determine optimal sampling designs.
