		Minimum distance estimation in an imprecise probability model //
		A minimum distance estimator is calculated for an imprecise
		probability model. The imprecise probability model consists of
		upper coherent previsions whose credal sets are given by a
		finite number of constraints on the expectations. The parameter
		set is finite. The estimator chooses that parameter such that
		the empirical measure lies next to the corresponding credal set
		with respect to the total variation norm.
