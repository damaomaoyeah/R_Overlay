		Nozzle Reports // The Nozzle package provides an API to generate
		HTML reports with dynamic user interface elements based on
		JavaScript and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Nozzle was
		designed to facilitate summarization and rapid browsing of
		complex results in data analysis pipelines where multiple
		analyses are performed frequently on big data sets. The package
		can be applied to any project where user-friendly reports need
		to be created.
