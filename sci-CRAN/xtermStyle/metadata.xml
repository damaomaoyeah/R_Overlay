		Terminal Text Formatting Using Escape Sequences // Can be used
		for coloring output in terminals. It was developed for the
		standard Ubuntu terminal but should be compatible with any
		terminal using xterm or ANSI escape sequences. If run in
		windows, RStudio, or any other platform not supporting such
		escape sequences it gracefully passes on any output without
		modifying it.
