		A Parallel-Voting Version of the Support-Vector-Machine Algorithm
		// By sampling your data, running the Support-Vector-Machine
		algorithm on these samples in parallel on your own machine and
		letting your models vote on a prediction, we return much faster
		predictions than the regular Support-Vector-Machine and
		possibly even more accurate predictions.
