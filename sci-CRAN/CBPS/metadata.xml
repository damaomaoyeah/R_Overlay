		R Package for Covariate Balancing Propensity Score // CBPS is an
		R package that implements the covariate balancing propensity
		score proposed by Imai and Ratkovic (2014; JRSSB). The
		propensity score is estimated such that it maximizes the
		resulting covariate balance as well as the prediction of
		treatment assignment. The method, therefore, avoids an
		iteration between model fitting and balance checking.  The
		package also implements several extensions of the CBPS beyond
		the cross-sectional, binary treatment setting.  The current
		version implements the CBPS for longitudinal settings so that
		it can be used in conjunction with marginal structural models
		(Imai and Ratkovic, 2013a), treatments with three- and four-
		valued treatment variables, continuous-valued treatments (Fong,
		Imai, and Ratkovic), and the situation with multiple distinct
		binary treatments administered simultaneously. In the future it
		will be extended to other settings including the generalization
		of experimental and instrumental variable estimates.
