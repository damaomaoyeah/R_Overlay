		Covariate Balancing Propensity Score // Implements the covariate
		balancing propensity score (CBPS) proposed by Imai and Ratkovic
		(2014; JRSSB). The propensity score is estimated such that it
		maximizes the resulting covariate balance as well as the
		prediction of treatment assignment. The method, therefore,
		avoids an iteration between model fitting and balance checking.
		The package also implements several extensions of the CBPS
		beyond the cross-sectional, binary treatment setting.  The
		current version implements the CBPS for longitudinal settings
		so that it can be used in conjunction with marginal structural
		models (Imai and Ratkovic, 2014), treatments with three- and
		four-valued treatment variables, continuous-valued treatments
		(Fong, Hazlett, and Imai, 2015), and the situation with
		multiple distinct binary treatments administered
		simultaneously. In the future it will be extended to other
		settings including the generalization of experimental and
		instrumental variable estimates.
