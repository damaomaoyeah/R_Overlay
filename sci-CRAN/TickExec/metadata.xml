		Execution Functions for Tick Data Back Test // Functions to
		execute orders in backtesting using tick data. A testing
		platform was established by the four major execution functions,
		namely 'LimitBuy', 'LimitSell', 'MarketBuy' and 'MarketSell',
		which enclosed all tedious aspects (such as queueing for order
		executions and calculate actual executed volumes) for order
		execution using tick data. Such that one can focus on the logic
		of strategies, rather than its execution.
