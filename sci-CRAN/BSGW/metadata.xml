		Bayesian Survival Model with Lasso Shrinkage Using Generalized
		Weibull Regression // Bayesian survival model using Weibull
		regression on both scale and shape parameters. Dependence of
		shape parameter on covariates permits deviation from
		proportional-hazard assumption, leading to dynamic - i.e. non-
		constant with time - hazard ratios between subjects. Bayesian
		Lasso shrinkage in the form of two Laplace priors - one for
		scale and one for shape coefficients - allows for many
		covariates to be included. Cross-validation helper functions
		can be used to tune the shrinkage parameters. Monte Carlo
		Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling using a Gibbs wrapper around
		Radford Neal's univariate slice sampler (R package MfUSampler)
		is used for coefficient estimation.
