		Power calculations and Bayesian analysis of count distributions
		and FECRT data using MCMC // A set of functions to allow
		analysis of count data (such as faecal egg count data) using
		Bayesian MCMC methods.  Returns information on the possible
		values for mean count, coefficient of variation and zero
		inflation (true prevalence) present in the data.  A complete
		faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) model is implemented,
		which returns inference on the true efficacy of the drug from
		the pre and post treatment data provided, using non-parametric
		bootstrapping as well as using Bayesian MCMC.  Functions to
		perform power analyses for faecal egg counts (including FECRT)
		are also provided.  Requires Just Another Gibbs Sampler (JAGS)
		for most functions (except power analysis calculations), see:
		http://www-fis.iarc.fr/~martyn/software/jags/.
