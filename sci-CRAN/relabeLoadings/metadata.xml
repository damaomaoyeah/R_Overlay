		Relabel Loadings from MCMC Output for Confirmatory Factor
		Analysis // In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural
		constraints typically ensure that the model is identified up to
		all possible reflections, i.e., column sign changes of the
		matrix of loadings. Such reflection invariance is problematic
		for Bayesian CFA when the reflection modes are not well
		separated in the posterior distribution. Imposing rotational
		constraints -- fixing some loadings to be zero or positive in
		order to pick a factor solution that corresponds to one
		reflection mode -- may not provide a satisfactory solution for
		Bayesian CFA. The function 'relabel' uses the relabeling
		algorithm of Erosheva and Curtis to correct for sign invariance
		in MCMC draws from CFA models. The MCMC draws should come from
		Bayesian CFA models that are fit without rotational
		constraints.
