		Functions for Performing Local FDR Estimation when Null and
		Alternative are Poisson // The main idea of the Local FDR
		algorithm is to estimate both proportion of null observations
		and the ratio of null and alternative densities. In the case
		that there are many null observations, this can be done
		reliably, through maximum likelihood or generalized linear
		models. This package implements this in the case that the null
		and alternative densities are Poisson.
