		Analysis of chromosomal interactions data (correction,
		segmentation and comparison) // chromoR provides users with a
		statistical pipeline for analysing chromosomal interactions
		data (Hi-C data).It combines wavelet methods and a Bayesian
		approach for correction (bias and noise) and comparison
		(detecting significant changes between Hi-C maps) of Hi-C
		contact maps.In addition, it also support detection of change
		points in 1D Hi-C contact profiles.
