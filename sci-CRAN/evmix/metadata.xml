		Extreme Value Mixture Modelling, Threshold Estimation and
		Boundary Corrected Kernel Density Estimation // The usual
		distribution functions, maximum likelihood inference and model
		diagnostics for univariate stationary extreme value mixture
		models are provided. Kernel density estimation including
		various boundary corrected kernel density estimation methods
		and a wide choice of kernels, with cross-validation likelihood
		based bandwidth estimator. Reasonable consistency with the base
		functions in the 'evd' package is provided, so that users can
		safely interchange most code.
