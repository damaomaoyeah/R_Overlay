		Modeling and Inferring Gene Networks // Analyzes gene expression
		(time series) data with focus on the inference of gene
		networks. In particular, GeneNet implements the methods of
		Schaefer and Strimmer (2005a,b,c) and Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer
		(2006, 2007) for learning large-scale gene association networks
		(including assignment of putative directions).
