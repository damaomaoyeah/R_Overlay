		Statistical Analysis and Data Display: Heiberger and Holland //
		Support software for Statistical Analysis and Data Display
		(First Edition, Springer, ISBN 0-387-40270-5, 2004) and (Second
		Edition, Springer, ISBN 978-1-4939-2121-8, anticipated 2015) by
		Richard M. Heiberger and Burt Holland.  This contemporary
		presentation of statistical methods features extensive use of
		graphical displays for exploring data and for displaying the
		analysis.  The second edition includes redesigned graphics and
		additional chapters. The authors emphasize how to construct and
		interpret graphs, discuss principles of graphical design, and
		show how accompanying traditional tabular results are used to
		confirm the visual impressions derived directly from the
		graphs. Many of the graphical formats are novel and appear here
		for the first time in print.  All chapters have exercises.  All
		functions introduced in the book are in the package.  R code
		for all examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is
		included in the scripts directory of the package.
