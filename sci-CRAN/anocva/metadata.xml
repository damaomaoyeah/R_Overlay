		A Non-Parametric Statistical Test to Compare Clustering
		Structures // Provides ANOCVA (ANalysis Of Cluster
		VAriability), a non-parametric statistical test to compare
		clustering structures with applications in functional magnetic
		resonance imaging data (fMRI). The ANOCVA allows us to compare
		the clustering structure of multiple groups simultaneously and
		also to identify features that contribute to the differential
		clustering.
