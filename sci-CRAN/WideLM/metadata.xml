		Fitting many skinny linear models to a single data set // WideLM
		fits large numbers of linear models to a fixed design matrix
		and response.  An Nvidia GPU is used to accelerate model
		fitting, with the CUDA API enabling parallel execution of
		multiple individual fits.  The individual models must have
		modest size.  The package implements a chunking interface to
		the GPU kernel, allowing the caller to stream model
		specifications.  Hence the number of fits to be performed is
		essentially unlimited.
