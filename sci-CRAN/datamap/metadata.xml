		A system for mapping foreign objects to R variables and
		environments // datamap utilizes variable bindings and objects
		of class "UserDefinedDatabase" to provide a simple mapping
		system to foreign objects. Maps can be used as environments or
		attached to the search path, and changes to either are
		persistent. Mapped foreign objects are fetched in real-time and
		are never cached by the mapping system.
