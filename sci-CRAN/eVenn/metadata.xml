		A Powerful Tool to Quickly Compare Huge Lists and Draw Venn
		Diagrams // Compute a matrix comparison of lists (from 2 to
		infinite) and plot the results in a Venn diagram if (N=4) with
		regulation details. It allows to produce a complete annotated
		file, merging the annotations of the compared lists. It is also
		possible to compute an overlaps table to show the overlaps
		proportions of all the couples of lists and draw proportional
		Venn diagrams.
