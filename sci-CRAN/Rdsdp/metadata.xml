		R Interface to DSDP Semidefinite Programming Library // R
		interface to DSDP semidefinite programming library. The DSDP
		software is a free open source implementation of an interior-
		point method for semidefinite programming. It provides primal
		and dual solutions, exploits low-rank structure and sparsity in
		the data, and has relatively low memory requirements for an
		interior-point method.
