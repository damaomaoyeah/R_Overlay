		Local and remote system commands with output and error capture.
		// This package provides utility functions for system command
		execution, both locally and remotely using ssh/scp. The command
		output is captured and provided to the caller. This
		functionality is intended to streamline calling shell commands
		from R, retrieving and using their output, while instrumenting
		the calls with appropriate error handling. NOTE: this first
		version is limited to unix with local and remote systems
		running bash as the default shell.
