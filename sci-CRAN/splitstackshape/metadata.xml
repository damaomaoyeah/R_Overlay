		Stack and Reshape Datasets After Splitting Concatenated Values //
		Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export
		multiple-response questions with data concatenated in cells.
		The concat.split (cSplit) family of functions splits such data
		into separate cells. The package also includes functions to
		stack groups of columns and to reshape wide data, even when the
		data are "unbalanced"---something which reshape (from base R)
		does not handle, and which melt and dcast from reshape2 do not
		easily handle.
