		Functions to split concatenated data, conveniently stack columns
		of data.frames, and conveniently reshape data.frames. // Online
		data collection tools like Google Forms often export multiple-
		response questions with data concatenated in cells. The
		concat.split family of functions conveniently splits such data
		into separate cells. The package also includes functions to
		conveniently stack groups of columns and to reshape wide data,
		even when the data are "unbalanced"---something which reshape
		(from base R) does not handle, and which melt and dcast from
		reshape2 do not easily handle.
