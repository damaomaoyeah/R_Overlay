		Vulgar Fractions in R // The main function of this package allows
		numerical vector objects to be displayed with their values in
		vulgar fractional form.  This is convenient if patterns can
		then be more easily detected.  In some cases replacing the
		components of a numeric vector by a rational approximation can
		also be expected to remove some component of round-off error.
		The main functions form a re-implementation of the functions
		'fractions' and 'rational' of the MASS package, but using a
		radically improved programming strategy.
