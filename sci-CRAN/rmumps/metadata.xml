		Wrapper for MUMPS Library // Some basic features of MUMPS
		(MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver) are
		wrapped in a Rmumps class. It can be used for storing a sparse
		matrix and sequentially solving corresponding linear system
		with one or many right hand sides (in their turn dense or
		sparse). There is a possibility to do separately symbolic
		analysis, LU factorization and system solving.
