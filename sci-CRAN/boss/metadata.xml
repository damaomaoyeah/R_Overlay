		Boosted One-Step Statistics: Fast and accurate approximations for
		GLM, GEE and Mixed models for use in GWAS // BOSS uses
		parameter estimates obtained without genotype to boost standard
		one-step approximations, and precomputes as much as possible
		without genotype (using boss.set) to minimize effort required.
