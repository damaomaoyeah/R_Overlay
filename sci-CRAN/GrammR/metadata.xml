		Graphical Representation and Modeling of Metagenomic Reads //
		Represents metagenomic samples on the Euclidean space to
		examine similarity amongst samples by studying clusters in the
		model. Given the matrix of metagenomic counts for samples, this
		package (1) quantifies dissimilarity between samples using
		Kendall's tau-distance, (2) constructs multidimensional models
		of different dimension, and (3) plots the models for
		visualization and comparison.
