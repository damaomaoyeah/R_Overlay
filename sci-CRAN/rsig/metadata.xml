		Robust Signature Selection for Survival Outcomes // Robust and
		efficient feature selection algorithm to identify important
		features for predicting survival risk. The method is based on
		subsampling and averaging linear models obtained from the
		(preconditioned) Lasso algorithm, with an extra shrinking
		procedure to reduce the size of signatures. An evaluation
		procedure using subsampling is also provided.
