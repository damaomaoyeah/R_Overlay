		A Novel Topology-Based Pathway Enrichment Analysis Approach // We
		described a novel Topology-based pathway enrichment analysis,
		which integrated the global position of the nodes and the
		topological property of the pathways in  Kyoto Encyclopedia of
		Genes and Genomes Database. We also provide some functions to
		obtain the latest information about pathways to finish pathway
		enrichment analysis using this method.
