		Identification of dichotomous differential item functioning (DIF)
		using Angoff's Delta Plot method // The deltaPlotR package
		proposes an implementation of Angoff's Delta Plot method to
		detect dichotomous DIF. Several detection thresholds are
		included, either from multivariate normality assumption or by
		prior determination. Item purification is supported.
