		Estimate Lower Extreme Quantile with the Censored Weibull MLE and
		Censored Weibull Mixture // It implements the subjectively
		censored Weibull MLE and censored Weibull mixture methods for
		the lower quantile estimation. Quantile estimates from these
		two methods are robust to model misspecification in the lower
		tail. It also includes functions to evaluation the standard
		error of the resulting quantile estimates. Also, the methods
		here can be used to fit the Weibull or Weibull mixture for the
		Type-I or Type-II right censored data.
