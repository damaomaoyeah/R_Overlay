		EQS Output Conversion to lavaan Functions // Transitioning from
		EQS to R for structural equation modeling (SEM) is made easier
		with a set of functions to convert .out files into R code. The
		EQS output can be converted into lavaan syntax and run in the R
		environment.  Other functions parse descriptive statistics and
		the covariance matrix from an EQS .out file.  A heat map plot
		of a covariance matrix is also included.
