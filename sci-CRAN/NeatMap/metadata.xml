		Non-clustered heatmap alternatives // NeatMap is a package to
		create heatmap like plots in 2 and 3 dimensions, without the
		need for cluster analysis. Like the heatmap, the plots created
		by NeatMap display both a dimensionally reduced representation
		of the data as well as the data itself. They are intended to be
		used in conjunction with dimensional reduction techniques such
		as PCA.
