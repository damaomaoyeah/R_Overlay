		Easily Improve the User Experience of Your Shiny Apps in Seconds
		// Perform common useful JavaScript operations in Shiny apps
		that will greatly improve your apps without having to know any
		JavaScript. Examples include: hiding an element, disabling an
		input, resetting an input back to its original value, delaying
		code execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions
		for both the end user and the developer. 'shinyjs' can also be
		used to easily call your own custom JavaScript functions from
		R.
