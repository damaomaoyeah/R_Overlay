		Perform Common JavaScript Operations in Shiny Apps using Plain R
		Code // Perform common JavaScript operations in Shiny
		applications without having to know any JavaScript. Examples
		include hiding an element, disabling an input, resetting an
		input back to its original value, and many more useful
		functions. Even if you do know JavaScript, shinyjs can be used
		as convenience functions to avoid dealing with message passing
		and writing JavaScript code. shinyjs can also be used to easily
		run your own custom JavaScript functions from R.
