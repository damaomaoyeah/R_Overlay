		Multi-Site Auto-Regressive Weather GENerator // S3 and S4
		functions are implemented for spatial multi-site stochastic
		generation of daily time series of temperature and
		precipitation. These tools make use of Vector AutoRegressive
		models (VARs). The weather generator model is then saved as an
		object and is calibrated by daily instrumental "Gaussianized"
		time series through the 'vars' package tools. Once obtained
		this model, it can it can be used for weather generations and
		be adapted to work with several climatic monthly time series.
