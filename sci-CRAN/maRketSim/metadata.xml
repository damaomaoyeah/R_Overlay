		Market simulator for R // maRketSim is a market simulator for R.
		It was initially designed around the bond market, with plans to
		expand to stocks.  maRketSim is built around the idea of
		portfolios of fundamental objects.  Therefore it is slow in its
		current incarnation, but allows you the flexibility of seeing
		exactly what is in your final results, since the objects are
		retained.
