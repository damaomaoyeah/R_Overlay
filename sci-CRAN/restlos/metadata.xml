		Robust Estimation of Location and Scatter // The restlos package
		provides algorithms for robust estimation of location (mean and
		mode) and scatter based on minimum spanning trees (pMST), self-
		organizing maps (Flood Algorithm), Delaunay triangulations
		(RDELA), and nested minimum volume convex sets (MVCH). The
		functions are also suitable for outlier detection.
