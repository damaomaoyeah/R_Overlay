		Convex Switching Systems // The numerical treatment of optimal
		switching problems in a finite time setting when the state
		evolves as a controlled Markov chain consisting of a
		uncontrolled continuous component following linear dynamics and
		a controlled Markov chain taking values in a finite set. The
		reward functions are assumed to be convex and Lipschitz
		continuous in the continuous state. The action set is finite.
