		The Skillings-Mack Test Statistic for Block Designs with Missing
		Observations // A generalization of the statistic used in
		Friedman's ANOVA method and in Durbin's rank test. This
		nonparametric statistical test is useful for the data obtained
		from block designs with missing observations occurring
		randomly. A resulting p-value is based on the chi-squared
		distribution and Monte Carlo method.
