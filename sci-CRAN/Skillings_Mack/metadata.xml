		The Skillings-Mack test Statistic for block designs with missing
		observations // The Skillings-Mack test statistic is a
		generalization of the statistic used in Friedman's ANOVA method
		and in Durbin's rank test. This nonparametric statistical test
		is useful for the data obtained from block designs with missing
		observations occurring randomly. The results from the SkiMack
		function are the Skillings-Mack statistic, p-values based on
		the chi-squared distribution and Monte Carlo method. The Monte
		Carlo method is recommended for approximating p-values when
		there are many ties and/or small designs with missing values
		are conducted.
