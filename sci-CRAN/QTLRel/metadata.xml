		Tools for mapping of quantitative traits of genetically related
		individuals and calculating identity coefficients from a
		pedigree // This software provides tools for quantitative trait
		mapping in populations such as advanced intercross lines where
		relatedness among individuals should not be ignored. It can
		estimate background genetic variance components, impute missing
		genotypes, simulate genotypes, perform a genome scan for
		putative quantitative trait loci (QTL), and plot mapping
		results. It also has functions to calculate identity
		coefficients from pedigrees, especially suitable for pedigrees
		that consist of a large number of generations, or estimate
		identity coefficients from genotypic data in certain
		circumstances.
