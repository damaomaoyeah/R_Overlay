		diversitree: comparative phylogenetic analyses of diversification
		// Contains a number of comparative phylogenetic methods,
		mostly focusing on analysing diversification and character
		evolution.  Contains implementations of BiSSE (Binary State
		Speciation and Extinction; Maddison et al. 2007: Syst. Biol.
		56: 701) and its unresolved tree extensions (FitzJohn et al.
		2009: Syst. Biol. 58: 595), MuSSE (Multiple State Speciation
		and Extinction), QuaSSE (Quantitative State Speciation and
		Extinction; FitzJohn 2010: Syst. Biol. 59: 619), GeoSSE
		(Geographic State Speciation and Extinction; Goldberg et al.
		2011: Syst. Biol. 60: 451), and BiSSE-ness (Magnuson-Ford and
		Otto 2012: Am. Nat.) Other included methods include Markov
		models of discrete and continuous trait evolution and constant
		rate speciation and extinction.
