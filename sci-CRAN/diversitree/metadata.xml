		Comparative 'Phylogenetic' Analyses of Diversification //
		Contains a number of comparative 'phylogenetic' methods, mostly
		focusing on analysing diversification and character evolution.
		Contains implementations of 'BiSSE' (Binary State 'Speciation'
		and Extinction) and its unresolved tree extensions, 'MuSSE'
		(Multiple State 'Speciation' and Extinction), 'QuaSSE',
		'GeoSSE', and 'BiSSE-ness' Other included methods include
		Markov models of discrete and continuous trait evolution and
		constant rate 'speciation' and extinction.
