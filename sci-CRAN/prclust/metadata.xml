		Penalized Regression-Based Clustering Method // Clustering is
		unsupervised and exploratory in nature. Yet, it can be
		performed through penalized regression with grouping pursuit.
		In this package, we provide two algorithms for fitting the
		penalized regression-based clustering (PRclust). One algorithm
		is based on quadratic penalty and difference convex method.
		Another algorithm is based on difference convex and ADMM,
		called DC-ADD, which is more efficient. Generalized cross
		validation was provided to select the tuning parameters. Rand
		index, adjusted Rand index and Jaccard index were provided to
		estimate the agreement between estimated cluster memberships
		and the truth.
