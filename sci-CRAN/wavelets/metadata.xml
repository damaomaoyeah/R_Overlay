		A package of functions for computing wavelet filters, wavelet
		transforms and multiresolution analyses // This package
		contains functions for computing and plotting discrete wavelet
		transforms (DWT) and maximal overlap discrete wavelet
		transforms (MODWT), as well as their inverses. Additionally, it
		contains functionality for computing and plotting wavelet
		transform filters that are used in the above decompositions as
		well as multiresolution analyses.
