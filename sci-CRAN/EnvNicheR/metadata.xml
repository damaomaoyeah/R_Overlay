		Niche Estimation // A plot overlying the niche of multiple
		species is obtained: 1) to determine the niche conditions which
		favor a higher species richness, 2) to create a box plot with
		the range of environmental variables of the species, 3) to
		obtain a list of species in an area of the niche selected by
		the user and, 4) to estimate niche overlap among the species.
