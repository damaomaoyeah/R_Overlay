		Niche Estimation // A plot overlying the niche of multiple
		species is obtained, to determine the niche conditions which
		favor a higher species richness, to create boxplots with the
		range of environmental variables of the species, to obtain a
		list of species in an area of the niche selected by the user
		and to estimate niche overlap among the species. It uses an
		output file of the software ModestR, which is available at the
		web site www.ipez.es/ModestR.
