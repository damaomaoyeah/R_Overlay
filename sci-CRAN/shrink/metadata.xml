		Global, Parameterwise and Joint Post-Estimation Shrinkage //
		Post-estimation shrinkage of regression coefficients in
		statistical modeling can be used to correct for the
		overestimation of regression coefficients caused by variable
		selection. While global shrinkage modifies all regression
		coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage
		factors differ between regression coefficients. With variables
		which are either highly correlated or associated with regard to
		contents, such as several columns of a design matrix describing
		a nonlinear effect, parameterwise shrinkage factors are not
		interpretable and a compromise between global and parameterwise
		shrinkage, termed 'joint shrinkage', is a useful extension. A
		computational shortcut to resampling-based shrinkage factor
		estimation based on DFBETA residuals can be applied. Global,
		parameterwise and joint shrinkage for models fitted by lm, glm,
		coxph, or (for R = 3.1.0) mfp is available.
