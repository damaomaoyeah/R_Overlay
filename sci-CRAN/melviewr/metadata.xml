		View and Classify MELODIC Output for ICA+FIX // Provides a
		graphical interface that allows the user to easily view and
		classify output from 'MELODIC', a part of the 'FSL'
		neuroimaging analysis software suite that performs independent
		component analysis (ICA; see
		https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MELODIC/ for more
		information). The user categorizes a component as signal or
		noise based on its spatial and temporal characteristics and can
		then save a text file of these classifications in the format
		required by 'ICA+FIX', an automatic noise removal tool
		(https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FIX).
