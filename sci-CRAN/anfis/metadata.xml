		Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System in R // The package
		implements ANFIS Type 3 Takagi and Sugeno's fuzzy if-then rule
		network with the following features: (1) Independent number of
		membership functions(MF) for each input, and also different MF
		extensible types. (2) Type 3 Takagi and Sugeno's fuzzy if-then
		rule (3) Full Rule combinations, e.g. 2 inputs 2 membership
		funtions - 4 fuzzy rules (4) Hibrid learning, i.e. Descent
		Gradient for precedents and Least Squares Estimation for
