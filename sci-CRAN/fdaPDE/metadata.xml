		Regression with Partial Differential Regularizations, using the
		Finite Element Method // An implementation of regression models
		with partial differential regularizations, making use of the
		Finite Element Method. The models efficiently handle data
		distributed over irregularly shaped domains and can comply with
		various conditions at the boundaries of the domain. A priori
		information about the spatial structure of the phenomenon under
		study can be incorporated in the model via the differential
		regularization.
