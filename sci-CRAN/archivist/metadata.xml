		Tools for Storing, Restoring and Searching for R Objects // Data
		exploration and modelling is a process in which a lot of data
		artifacts are produced. Artifacts like: subsets, data
		aggregates, plots, statistical models, different versions of
		data sets and different versions of results. The more projects
		we work with the more artifacts are produced and the harder it
		is to manage these artifacts. Archivist helps to store and
		manage artifacts created in R. Archivist allows you to store
		selected artifacts as a binary files together with their
		metadata and relations. Archivist allows to share artifacts
		with others, either through shared folder or github. Archivist
		allows to look for already created artifacts by using it's
		class, name, date of the creation or other properties. Makes it
		easy to restore such artifacts. Archivist allows to check if
		new artifact is the exact copy that was produced some time ago.
		That might be useful either for testing or caching.
