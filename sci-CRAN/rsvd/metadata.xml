		Randomized Singular Value Decomposition // Randomized singular
		value decomposition (rsvd) is a very fast probabilistic
		algorithm to compute an approximated low-rank singular value
		decomposition of large data sets with high accuracy. SVD plays
		a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. SVD
		is also widely used for computing principal component analysis
		(PCA), a linear dimensionality reduction technique. Randomized
		PCA (rpca) is using the approximated singular value
		decomposition to compute the most significant principal
		components. In addition several plot functions are provided.
