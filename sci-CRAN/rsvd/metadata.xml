		Randomized Singular Value Decomposition // Randomized singular
		value decomposition (rsvd) is a very fast probabilistic
		algorithm that can be used to compute the near optimal low-rank
		singular value decomposition of massive data sets with high
		accuracy. SVD plays a central role in data analysis and
		scientific computing. SVD is also widely used for computing
		(randomized) principal component analysis (PCA), a linear
		dimensionality reduction technique. Randomized PCA (rpca) uses
		the approximated singular value decomposition to compute the
		most significant principal components. This package also
		includes a function to compute (randomized) robust principal
		component analysis (RPCA). In addition several plot functions
		are provided.
