		Generalized Survival Models // R implementation of generalized
		survival models, where g(S(t(x))) for a link function g,
		survival S at time t with covariates x is modelled using a
		linear predictor. The main assumption is that the time
		effect(s) are smooth. For fully parametric models, this re-
		implements Stata's 'stpm2' function, which are flexible
		parametric survival models developed by Royston and colleagues.
		We have extended the parametric models to include any smooth
		parametric smoothers. We have also extended the model to
		include any smooth penalized smoothers from the 'mgcv' package,
		using penalized likelihood. These models have all been extended
		to include left truncation, right censoring, interval
		censoring, frailties and normal random effects.
