		Fast k-Nearest Neighbors // Compute labels for a test set
		according to the k-Nearest Neighbors classification. This is a
		fast way to do k-Nearest Neighbors classification because the
		distance matrix -between the features of the observations- is
		an input to the function rather than being calculated in the
		function itself every time.
