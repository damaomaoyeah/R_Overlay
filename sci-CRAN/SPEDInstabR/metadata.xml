		Estimation of the Relative Importance of Factors Affecting
		Species Distribution Based on Stability Concept // From output
		files obtained from the software ModestR, the relative
		contribution of factors to explain species distribution is
		depicted using several plots. A global geographic raster file
		for each environmental variable may be also obtained with the
		mean relative contribution, considering all species present in
		each raster cell, of the factor to explain species
		distribution. Finally, for each variable it is also possible to
		compare the frequencies of any variable obtained in the cells
		where the species is present with the frequencies of the same
		variable in the cells of the extent.
