		Learn from training data then quickly fill in missing data. //
		TrainFastImputation uses training data to describe a
		multivariate normal distribution that the data approximates or
		can be transformed into approximating and stores this
		information as an object of class FastImputationPatterns. The
		FastImputation function uses this FastImputationPatterns object
		to impute (make a good guess at) missing data in a single line
		or a whole dataframe of data.  This approximates the process
		used by Amelia [http://gking.harvard.edu/amelia/] but is much
		faster when filling in values for a single line of data.
