		Radiocarbon dating, age-depth modelling, relative sea level rate
		estimation, and non-parametric phase modelling // This package
		enables quick calibration of radiocarbon dates under various
		calibration curves (including user generated ones); Age-depth
		modelling as per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008);
		Relative sea level rate estimation incorporating time
		uncertainty in polynomial regression models; and non-parametric
		phase modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine
		the activity of a site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal
		function SUM).
