		Radiocarbon Dating, Age-Depth Modelling, Relative Sea Level Rate
		Estimation, and Non-Parametric Phase Modelling // Enables quick
		calibration of radiocarbon dates under various calibration
		curves (including user generated ones); Age-depth modelling as
		per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008); Relative sea
		level rate estimation incorporating time uncertainty in
		polynomial regression models; and non-parametric phase
		modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the
		activity of a site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function
		SUM). The package includes a vignette which can be accessed via
		vignette(Bchron).
