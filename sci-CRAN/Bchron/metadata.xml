		Radiocarbon Dating, Age-Depth Modelling, Relative Sea Level Rate
		Estimation, and Non-Parametric Phase Modelling // Enables quick
		calibration of radiocarbon dates under various calibration
		curves (including user generated ones); Age-depth modelling as
		per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008)
		DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x; Relative sea level rate
		estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial
		regression models; and non-parametric phase modelling via
		Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the activity of a
		site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM). The
		package includes a vignette which explains most of the basic
		functionality.
