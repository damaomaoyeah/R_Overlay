		Importing Data from Loligo Systems Software, Calculating
		Metabolic Rates and Critical Tensions // Analysis of oxygen
		consumption data generated by Loligo (R) Systems respirometry
		equipment. The package includes a function for loading data
		output by Loligo's 'AutoResp' software (get.witrox.data()),
		functions for calculating metabolic rates over user-specified
		time intervals, extracting critical points from data using
		broken stick regressions based on Yeager and Ultsch
		(DOI:10.1086/physzool.62.4.30157935), and easy functions for
		converting between different units of barometric pressure.
