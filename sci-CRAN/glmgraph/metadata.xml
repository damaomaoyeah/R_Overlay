		Graph-Constrained Regularization for Sparse Generalized Linear
		Models // We propose to use sparse regression model to achieve
		variable selection while accounting for graph-constraints among
		coefficients. Different linear combination of a sparsity
		penalty(L1) and a smoothness(MCP) penalty has been used, which
		induces both sparsity of the solution and certain smoothness on
		the linear coefficients.
