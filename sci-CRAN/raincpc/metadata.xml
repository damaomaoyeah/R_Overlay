		Obtain and Analyze Rainfall Data from the Climate Prediction
		Center // The Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) rainfall data
		for the world (1979 to present, 50 km resolution) and the USA
		(1948 to present, 25 km resolution), is one of the few high
		quality, long term, observation based, daily rainfall products
		available for free. Although raw data is available at CPC's ftp
		site, obtaining, processing and visualizing the data is not
		straightforward. There are more than 12,000 files for the world
		and about 24,000 files for the USA. Moreover, file formats and
		file extensions have not been consistent. This package provides
		functionality to download, process and visualize over 35 years
		of global rainfall data and over 65 years of USA rainfall data
		from CPC.
