		Computation of the probability of ruin within a finite time
		horizon // In the CramrLundberg risk process perturbed by a
		Wiener process, this packages provides approximations to the
		probability of ruin within a finite time horizon.  Currently,
		there are three methods implemented: The first one uses
		saddlepoint approximation (two variants are provided), the
		second one uses importance sampling and the third one is based
		on the simulation of a dual process.  This last method is not
		very accurate and only given here for completeness.
