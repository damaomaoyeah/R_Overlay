		Light Cone Reconstruction of States - Predictive State Estimation
		From Spatio-Temporal Data // Estimates predictive states from
		spatio-temporal data and consequently can provide provably
		optimal forecasts. Currently this implementation supports an
		N-dimensional spatial grid observed over equally spaced time
		intervals. E.g. a video is a 2D spatial systems observed over
		time. This package implements mixed LICORS, has plotting tools
		(for (1+1)D and (2+1)D systems), and methods for optimal
		forecasting.  Due to memory limitations it is recommend to only
		analyze (1+1)D systems.
