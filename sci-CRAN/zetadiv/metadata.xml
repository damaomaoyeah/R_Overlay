		Functions to Compute Compositional Turnover Using Zeta Diversity
		// Functions to compute compositional turnover using zeta-
		diversity, the number of species shared by multiple
		assemblages. The package includes a Zeta.order() function to
		compute zeta-diversity for a specific number of assemblages,
		and a Zeta.decline() function to compute zeta-diversity for a
		range of numbers of assemblages. It also includes additional
		functions to explain how zeta-diversity varies with distance
		and with differences of environmental variables between
		assemblages, using linear regressions and generalized additive
		models.
