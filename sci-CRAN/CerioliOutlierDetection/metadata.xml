		Outlier detection using the iterated RMCD method of Cerioli
		(2010) // This package provides the iterated RMCD method of
		Cerioli (2010) for multivariate outlier detection via robust
		Mahalanobis distances. It also provides the finite-sample RMCD
		method discussed in the paper, as well as the methods provided
