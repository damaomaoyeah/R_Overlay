		Association Between Methylation and a Phenotype of Interest // Is
		designed to test for association between methylation at CpG
		sites across the genome and a phenotype of interest, adjusting
		for any relevant covariates. The package can perform standard
		analyses of large datasets very quickly with no need to impute
		the data. It can also handle mixed effects models with chip or
		batch entering the model as a random intercept. Also includes
		tools to apply quality control filters, perform permutation
		tests, and create QQ plots, manhattan plots, and scatterplots
		for individual CpG sites.
