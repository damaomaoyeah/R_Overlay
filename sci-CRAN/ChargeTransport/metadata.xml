		Charge Transfer Rates and Charge Carrier Mobilities // This
		package provides functions to compute Marcus, Marcus-Levich-
		Jortner or Landau-Zener charge transfer rates. These rates can
		then be used to perform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to
		estimate charge carrier mobilities in molecular materials. The
		preparation of this package was supported by the the Fondazione
		Cariplo (PLENOS project, ref. 2011-0349).
