		CITation ANalysis toolpack // CITAN is a library of functions
		useful in - but not limited to - quantitative research in the
		field of scientometrics. It contains various tools for
		preprocessing bibliographic data retrieved e.g. from Elsevier's
		SciVerse Scopus and calculating bibliometric impact of
		individuals. Also, many functions dealing with Pareto-Type II
		(GPD) and Discretized Pareto-Type II statistical models are
		included (e.g. Zhang-Stephens and MLE estimators, goodness-of-
		fit and two-sample tests, confidence intervals for the
		theoretical Hirsch index etc.). They may be used to describe
		and analyze many phenomena encountered in the social sciences.
