		Latent Environmental  Genetic InTeraction (LEGIT) Model //
		Constructs genotype x environment interaction (GxE) models
		where G is a weighted sum of genetic variants (genetic score)
		and E is a weighted sum of environments (environmental score).
		This approach has greatly enhanced predictive power over
		traditional GxE models which include only a single genetic
		variant and a single environmental exposure. Gene x gene
		interactions (GxG) and environment x environment interactions
		(ExE) can be incorporated into the genetic and environmental
		scores. Any standard model formula can be used, it doesn't have
		to be a two-way interaction model. Although this approach was
		made for GxE modelling, the genetic score doesn't need to
		contain genetic variables and the environmental score doesn't
		need to contain environmental variables, therefore this
		approach is highly flexible. A paper discussing the method used
		for estimating the weights should be released as pre-print and
		sent for peer- review before Summer 2017.
