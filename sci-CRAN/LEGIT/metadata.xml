		Latent Environmental  Genetic InTeraction (LEGIT) Model //
		Constructs genotype x environment interaction (GxE) models
		where G is a weighted sum of genetic variants (genetic score)
		and E is a weighted sum of environments (environmental score)
		using the alternating optimization algorithm by Jolicoeur-
		Martineau et al. (2017) arXiv:1703.08111. Alternating
		optimization is an iterative process where the genetic score
		weights, the environmental score weights, and the main model
		parameters are estimated in turn assuming the other parameters
		to be constant. This approach has greatly enhanced predictive
		power over traditional GxE models which include only a single
		genetic variant and a single environmental exposure. Gene x
		gene interactions (GxG) and environment x environment
		interactions (ExE) can be incorporated into the genetic and
		environmental scores. Any standard model formula can be used,
		it doesn't have to be a two-way interaction model. Although
		this approach was made for GxE modelling, the genetic score
		doesn't need to contain genetic variables and the environmental
		score doesn't need to contain environmental variables,
		therefore this approach is highly flexible.
