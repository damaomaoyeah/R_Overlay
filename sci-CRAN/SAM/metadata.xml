		Sparse Additive Modelling // The package SAM targets at high
		dimensional predictive modeling (regression and classification)
		for complex data analysis. SAM is short for sparse additive
		modeling, and adopts the computationally efficient basis spline
		technique. We solve the optimization problems by various
		computational algorithms including the block coordinate descent
		algorithm, fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm, and
		newton method. The computation is further accelerated by warm-
		start and active-set tricks.
