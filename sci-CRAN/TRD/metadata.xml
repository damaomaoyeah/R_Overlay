		Transmission Ratio Distortion // Transmission Ratio Distortion
		(TRD) is a genetic phenomenon where two alleles from either
		parent are not transmitted to the offspring at the Mendelian
		1:1 ratio. Occurrence of TRD in general population can lead to
		false inflation or attenuation of association signals in case
		populations. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust for TRD in
		model fitting of case populations. This package uses models
		such as loglinear model (Weinberg 1998), augmented loglinear
		model (Huang 2014), and tests such as TDT (Spielman 1993),
		augmented TDT (Labbe 2013), on simulated or real datasets. This
		package has a simulation function which generates a population
		that is under the influence of TRD, and samples a sub-
		population, which can serve as the dataset to fit a loglinear
		model or to perform a TDT. Real dataset with the same data
		structure as described in the help file of the function 'll'
		can also be used in the loglinear model and the TDT functions.
		No real dataset is included in this package.
