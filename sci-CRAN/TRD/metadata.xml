		Transmission Ratio Distortion // Transmission Ratio Distortion
		(TRD) is a genetic phenomenon where the two alleles from either
		parent are not transmitted to the offspring at the expected 1:1
		ratio under Mendelian inheritance, leading to spurious signals
		in genetic association studies. Functions in this package are
		developed to account for this phenomenon using loglinear model
		and Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT). Some population
		information can also be calculated.
