		Transcription Factor Binding Site Identification Tool //
		Identifies and scores possible Transcription Factor Binding
		Sites and allows for FDR analysis and pruning.  It supports
		splitting of sequences based on size or a specified GFF,
		grouping by G+C content, and specification of Markov model
		order.  The heavy lifting is done in C while all results are
		made available via R.
