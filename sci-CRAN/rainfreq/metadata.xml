		Rainfall Frequency (Design Storm) Estimates from the US National
		Weather Service // Estimates of rainfall at desired frequency
		(e.g., 1% annual chance or 100-year return period) and desired
		duration (e.g., 24-hour duration) are often required in the
		design of dams and other hydraulic structures, catastrophe risk
		modeling, environmental planning and management. One major
		source of such estimates for the USA is the NOAA National
		Weather Service's (NWS) division of Hydrometeorological Design
		Studies Center (HDSC). Raw data from NWS-HDSC is available at
		1-km resolution and comes as a huge number of GIS files. This
		package provides functionality to easily access and analyze the
		1-km GIS files provided by NWS' PF Data Server for the entire
		USA. This package also comes with datasets on record point
		rainfall measurements provided by NWS-HDSC.
