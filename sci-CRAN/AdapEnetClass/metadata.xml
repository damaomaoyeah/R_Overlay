		A Class of Adaptive Elastic-net Methods for Censored Data //
		Provides new approaches to variable selection for censored data
		including its high-dimensionality, based on AFT models
		optimized using regularized weighted least squares. Approaches
		namely, a weighted elastic net, an adaptive elastic net, and
		two of their extensions by adding censoring observations as
		constraints into their model optimization frameworks are
		provided with both simulated and real (MCL) data examples.
