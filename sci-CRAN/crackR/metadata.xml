		Probabilistic damage tolerance analysis for fatigue cracking of
		metallic aerospace structures // Using a sampling-based
		approach (either sequential importance sampling or explicit
		Monte Carlo), this package can be used to perform a
		probabilistic damage tolerance for aircraft structures. It can
		model a single crack, or two simultaneously growing fatigue
		cracks (the so-called continuing damage problem). With a single
		crack, multiple types of future repairs are possible.
