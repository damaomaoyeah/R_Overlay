		Calculate the Number of Required Flows for Semiconductor
		Sequencing // Two methods for calculation of the number of
		required flows for semiconductor sequencing: 1. Using a
		simulation, the number of flows can be calculated for a
		concrete list of amplicons. 2. An exact combinatorial model is
		evaluated to calculate the number of flows for a random
		ensemble of sequences.
