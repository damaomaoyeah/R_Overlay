		R Analysis package for iDynoMiCS Simulation Results // iDynoMiCS
		is a computer program, developed by an international team of
		researchers, whose purpose is to model and simulate microbial
		communities in an individual-based way. It is described in
		detail in the paper "iDynoMiCS: next-generation individual-
		based modelling of biofilms" by Lardon et al, published in
		Environmental Microbiology in 2011. The simulation produces
		results in XML file format, describing the state of each
		species in each timestep (agent_State), a summary of the
		species statistics for a timepoint (agent_Sum), the state of
		each solute grid in each timestep (env_State) and a summary of
		the solutes for a timestep (env_Sum). This R package provides a
		means of reading this XML data into R such that the simulation
		response can be statistically analysed. iDynoMiCS is available
		from the website iDynoMiCS.org, where a full tutorial on using
		both the simulation and this R package is provided.
