		Stability Selection with Error Control // Resampling procedures
		to assess the stability of selected variables with additional
		finite sample error control for high-dimensional variable
		selection procedures such as Lasso or boosting. Both, standard
		stability selection (Meinshausen  Buhlmann, 2010,
		doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00740.x) and complementary pairs
		stability selection with improved error bounds (Shah  Samworth,
		2013, doi:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2011.01034.x) are implemented.
		The package can be combined with arbitrary user specified
		variable selection approaches.
