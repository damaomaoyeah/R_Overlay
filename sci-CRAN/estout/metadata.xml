		Estimates Output // This package is intended to speedup the
		process of creating model-comparing tables common in
		Macroeconomics. The function collection stores the estimates of
		several models and formats it to a table of the form estimate
		starred and std.err. below. The default output is LaTeX but
		output to CSV for later editing in a spreadsheet tool is
		possible as well. It works for linear models (lm) and panel
		models from the "plm"-package (plm). Two further implemented
		functions "descsto" and "desctab" enable you to export
		descriptive statistics of data-frames and single variables to
		LaTeX and CSV.
