		Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures // Generalized Fixed
		Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures (g-FSMTPs) are used to
		test a sequence of pre- ordered hypotheses. The proposed three
		Family-wise Error Rate (FWER) controlling g-FSMTPs utilize
		numbers of rejections and acceptances, all the procedures are
		designed under arbitrary dependence. The proposed two False
		Discovery Rate (FDR) controlling g-FSMTPs allows more but a
		given number of acceptances (k=1), the procedures are designed
		for arbitrary dependence and independence. The main functions
		for each proposed g-FSMTPs are designed to calculate adjusted
		p-values and critical values, respectively. For users'
		convenience, the output results also include the option of
		decision rules for convenience.
