		Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures // Several generalized
		/ directional Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures
		(FSMTPs) are developed for testing a sequence of pre-ordered
		hypotheses while controlling the FWER, FDR and Directional
		Error (mdFWER). All three FWER controlling generalized FSMTPs
		are designed under arbitrary dependence, which allow any number
		of acceptances. Two FDR controlling generalized FSMTPs are
		respectively designed under arbitrary dependence and
		independence, which allow more but a given number of
		acceptances. Two mdFWER controlling directional FSMTPs are
		respectively designed under arbitrary dependence and
		independence, which can also make directional decisions based
		on the signs of the test statistics. The main functions for
		each proposed generalized / directional FSMTPs are designed to
		calculate adjusted p-values and critical values, respectively.
		For users' convenience, the functions also provide the output
		option for printing decision rules.
