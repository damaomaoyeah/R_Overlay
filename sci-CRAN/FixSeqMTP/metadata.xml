		Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures // Several generalized
		Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures (g- FSMTPs) are
		developed for testing a sequence of pre-ordered hypotheses
		while controlling the FWER and FDR. All three FWER controlling
		g-FSMTPs are designed under arbitrary dependence, which allow
		any number of acceptances, and two FDR controlling g-FSMTPs are
		respectively designed under arbitrary dependence and
		independence, which allow more but a given number of
		acceptances. The main functions for each proposed g-FSMTPs are
		designed to calculate adjusted p-values and critical values,
		respectively. For users' convenience, the output results also
		include the option of decision rules for convenience.
