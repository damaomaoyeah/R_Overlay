		Balanced and spatially balanced sampling // This package includes
		methods that can select balanced and spatially balanced
		probability samples in multi-dimensional spaces with any
		prescribed inclusion probabilities. It contains fast (C++ via
		Rcpp) implementations of the included sampling methods. The
		local pivotal method and spatially correlated Poisson sampling
		(for spatially balanced sampling) are included. Also the cube
		method (for balanced sampling) and the local cube method (for
		doubly balanced sampling) are included.
