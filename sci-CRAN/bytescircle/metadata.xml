		Statistics About Bytes Contained in a File as a Circle Plot //
		Shows statistics about bytes contained in a file as a circle
		graph of deviations from mean in sigma increments. The function
		can be useful for statistically analyze the content of files in
		a glimpse: text files are shown as a green centered crown,
		compressed and encrypted files should be shown as equally
		distributed variations with a very low CV (sigma/mean), and
		other types of files can be classified between these two
		categories depending on their text vs binary content, which can
		be useful to quickly determine how information is stored inside
		them (databases, multimedia files, etc).
