		Statistical Analyses of De Novo Genetic Variants // An integrated
		toolset for the analysis of de novo (sporadic) genetic sequence
		variants. denovolyzeR implements a mutational model that
		estimates the probability of a de novo genetic variant arising
		in each human gene, from which one can infer the expected
		number of de novo variants in a given population size. Observed
		variant frequencies can then be compared against expectation in
		a Poisson framework. denovolyzeR provides a suite of functions
		to implement these analyses for the interpretation of de novo
		variation in human disease.
