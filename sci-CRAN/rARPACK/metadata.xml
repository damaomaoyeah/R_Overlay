		Solvers for Large Scale Eigenvalue and SVD Problems // Previously
		an R wrapper of the 'ARPACK' library
		http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/, and from version
		0.8-0 an R interface to the 'Spectra' library
		http://yixuan.cos.name/spectra/ to solve large scale
		eigenvalue/vector problems. It is typically used to compute a
		few eigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k
		largest eigenvalues, which is usually more efficient than
		eigen() if k  n. This package provides the 'eigs()' function
		which does the similar job as in 'Matlab', 'Octave', 'Python
		SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides the 'svds()' function to
		calculate the largest k singular values and corresponding
		singular vectors of a real matrix. Matrices can be given in
		either dense or sparse form.
