		R wrapper of ARPACK for large scale eigenvalue/vector problems,
		on both dense and sparse matrices // rARPACK is an R wrapper of
		the ARPACK library (http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/)
		to solve large scale eigenvalue/vector problems. It is
		typically used to compute a few eigenvalues/vectors of an n by
		n matrix, e.g., the k largest eigenvalues, which is usually
		more efficient than eigen() if k  n. This package provides the
		eigs() function which does the similar job as in Matlab,
		Octave, Python SciPy and Julia. It also provides the svds()
		function to calculate the largest k singular values and
		corresponding singular vectors of a real matrix. Matrices can
		be given in either dense or sparse form.
