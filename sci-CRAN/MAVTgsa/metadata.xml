		Three methods to identify differentially expressed gene sets,
		ordinary least square test, Multivariate Analysis Of Variance
		test with n contrasts and Random forest. // This package is a
		gene set analysis function for one-sided test (OLS), two-sided
		test (multivariate analysis of variance). If the experimental
		conditions are equal to 2, the p-value for Hotelling's t^2 test
		is calculated. If the experimental conditions are great than 2,
		the p-value for Wilks' Lambda is determined and post-hoc test
		is reported too. Three multiple comparison procedures, Dunnett,
		Tukey, and sequential pairwise comparison, are implemented. The
		program computes the p-values and FDR (false discovery rate)
		q-values for all gene sets. The p-values for individual genes
		in a significant gene set are also listed. MAVTgsa generates
		two visualization output: a p-value plot of gene sets (GSA
		plot) and a GST-plot of the empirical distribution function of
		the ranked test statistics of a given gene set. A Random
		Forests-based procedure is to identify gene sets that can
		accurately predict samples from different experimental
		conditions or are associated with the continuous phenotypes.
