		Methods for dimension reduction for regression // Functions,
		methods, and datasets for fitting dimension reduction
		regression, using slicing (methods SAVE and SIR), Principal
		Hessian Directions (phd, using residuals and the response), and
		an iterative IRE.  Partial methods, that condition on
		categorical predictors are also available.  A variety of tests,
		and stepwise deletion of predictors, is also included.  Also
		included is code for computing permutation tests of dimension.
		Adding additional methods of estimating dimension is
		straightforward. For documentation, see the vignette in the
		package.   With version 3.0.4, the arguments for dr.step have
		been modified.
