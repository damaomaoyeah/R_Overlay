		Elitist Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm based on R //
		This package provide functions for box-constrained
		multiobjective optimization using the elitist non-dominated
		sorting genetic algorithm - NSGA-II. Fast non-dominated
		sorting, crowding distance, tournament selection, simulated
		binary crossover, and polynomial mutation are called in the
		main program, nsga2R, to complete the search.
