		Prais-Winsten Estimation Procedure for AR(1) Serial Correlation
		// The Prais-Winsten estimation procedure takes into account
		serial correlation of type AR(1) in a linear model. The
		procedure is an iterative method that recursively estimates the
		beta coefficients and the error autocorrelation of the
		specified model until convergence of rho, i.e. the AR(1)
		coefficient, is attained. All estimates are obtained by OLS.
