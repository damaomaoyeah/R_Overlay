		Efficient Score Statistics For Genome-Wide SNP Set Analysis //
		RSNPset is an implementation of the use of efficient score
		statistics in genome-wide SNP set analysis with complex traits.
		The package provides three standard score statistics (Cox,
		binomial, and Gaussian) but is easily extensible to include
		others. Code implementing the inferential procedure is
		primarily written in C++ and utilizes parallelization of the
		analysis to reduce runtime. A supporting function offers simple
		computation of observed, permutation, and FWER and FDR adjusted
		p-values.
