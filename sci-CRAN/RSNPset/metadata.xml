		Efficient Score Statistics for Genome-Wide SNP Set Analysis // An
		implementation of the use of efficient score statistics in
		genome-wide SNP set analysis with complex traits. Three
		standard score statistics (Cox, binomial, and Gaussian) are
		provided, but the package is easily extensible to include
		others. Code implementing the inferential procedure is
		primarily written in C++ and utilizes parallelization of the
		analysis to reduce runtime. A supporting function offers simple
		computation of observed, permutation, and FWER and FDR adjusted
		p-values.
