		Statistical Inference for Parametric and Semiparametric Models
		Based on Dependently Truncated Data // Suppose that one can
		observe bivariate random variables (X, Y) only when X=Y holds.
		Data (Xj, Yj), subject to Xj=Yj, for all j=1,...,n, are called
		truncated data. Parametric approach (Emura  Konno 2012 Stat
		Papers), semiparametric approach (Chaieb et al. 2006
		Biometrika; Emura et al. 2011 Sinica; Emura  Murotani 2015
		TEST), nonparametric maximum likelihood approach (Emura  Wang
		2012 JMVA), and regression approach (Emura  Wang 2015 AISM) are
		implemented for statistical inference on (X, Y), when X and Y
		are dependent. Also included is truncated data on the number of
		deaths at each year (1963-1980) for Japanese male centenarians
		(Emura  Murotani 2015 TEST).
