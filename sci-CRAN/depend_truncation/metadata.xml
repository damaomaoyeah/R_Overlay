		Statistical Inference for Parametric and Semiparametric Models
		Based on Dependently Truncated Data // Suppose that one can
		observe bivariate random variables (X, Y) only when X=Y holds.
		Data (Xj, Yj), subject to Xj=Yj, for all j=1,...,n, are called
		truncated data. For truncated data, several different
		approaches are implemented for statistical inference on (X, Y),
		when X and Y are dependent. Also included is truncated data on
		the number of deaths at each year (1963-1980) for Japanese male
		centenarians.
