		This is an R package that constructs and manipulates population
		graphs. // This is a generic package that produces "Population
		Graphs" a graph-theoretic topology based upon conditional
		genetic covariance.  This functionality used to be within the
		gstudio package, but has been taken out to focus on spatial
		integration of graph topologies with existing packages like sp,
		raster, and ggplot2.
