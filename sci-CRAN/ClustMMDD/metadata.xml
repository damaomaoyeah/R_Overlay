		Variable Selection in Clustering by Mixture Models for Discrete
		Data // An implementation of a variable selection procedure in
		clustering by mixture of multinomial models for discrete data.
		Genotype data are examples of such data with two unordered
		observations (alleles) at each locus for diploid individual.
		The two-fold problem of variable selection and clustering is
		seen as a model selection problem where competing models are
		characterized by the number of clusters K, and the subset S of
		clustering variables. Competing models are compared by
		penalized maximum likelihood criteria. We considered asymptotic
		criteria such as Akaike and Bayesian Information criteria, and
		a family of penalized criteria with penalty function to be data
		driven calibrated.
