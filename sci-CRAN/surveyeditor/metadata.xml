		Generate a Survey that can be Completed by Survey Respondents //
		Help generate slides for surveys or experiments. The resulted
		slides allow the subject to respond with the use of the mouse
		(usual keyboard input is replaced with clicking on a virtual
		keyboard on the slide). Subjects' responses are saved to the
		user- specified location in the form of R-readable text file.
		To allow flexibility, each function in this package generates a
		particular type of slides thus general R function writing
		skills are required to compile these edited slides.
