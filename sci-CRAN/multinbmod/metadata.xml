		Regression analysis of overdispersed correlated count data //
		This is a likelihood approach for the regression analysis of
		overdispersed correlated count data with cluster varying
		covariates. The approach fits a multivariate negative binomial
		model by maximum likelihood and provides robust estimates of
		the regression coefficients.
