		Bayesian Analysis of Contingency Table Data // The function MC3()
		searches for log-linear models with the highest posterior
		probability. The function gibbsSampler() is a blocked Gibbs
		sampler for sampling from the posterior distribution of the
		log-linear parameters. The functions findPostMean() and
		findPostCov() compute the posterior mean and covariance matrix
		for decomposable models which, for these models, is available
		in closed form.
