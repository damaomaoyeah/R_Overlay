		Planing, Monitoring and Evaluating Oncological Phase 2 Studies //
		Purpose of this package is it to plan, monitor and evaluate
		oncological phase II studies. In general this kind of studies
		are single-arm trials with planned interim analysis and binary
		endpoint. To meet the resulting requirements, the package
		provides functions to calculate and evaluate "Simon's two-stage
		designs" and so called "subset designs". If you are unfamiliar
		with this package a good starting point is to take a closer
		look at the functions "getSolutions" and "getSolutionsSub1".
