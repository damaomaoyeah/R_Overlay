		Finds "Local Subnetworks" Within an Interaction Network which
		Show Enrichment for Differentially Expressed Genes //
		Implements the method described in "Network-based analysis of
		omics data: The LEAN method" [Gwinner Boulday (2016)
		DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw676] Given a protein interaction
		network and a list of p-values describing a measure of interest
		(as e.g. differential gene expression) this method computes an
		enrichment p-value for the protein neighborhood of each gene
		and compares it to a background distribution of randomly drawn
		p-values. The resulting scores are corrected for multiple
		testing and significant hits are returned in tabular format.
