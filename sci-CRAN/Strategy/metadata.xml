		Generic Framework to Analyze Trading Strategies // Users can
		build and test customized quantitative trading strategies. Some
		quantitative trading strategies are already implemented, e.g.
		various moving-average filters with trend following approaches.
		The implemented class called "Strategy" allows users to access
		several methods to analyze performance figures, plots and
		backtest the strategies. Furthermore, custom strategies can be
		added, a generic template is available. The custom strategies
		require a certain input and output so they can be called from
		the Strategy-constructor.
