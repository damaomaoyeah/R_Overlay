		Accelerated Failure Time Model with Generalized Estimating
		Equations // This package features both rank-based estimates
		and least square estimates to the Accelerated Failure Time
		(AFT) model. For rank-based estimation, it provides approaches
		that include the computationally efficient Gehan's weight and
		the general's weight such as the logrank weight. For the least
		square estimation, the estimating equation is solved  with
		Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Moreover, in
		multivariate cases, the dependence working correlation
		structure can be specified in GEE's setting.
