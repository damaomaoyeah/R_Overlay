		Monte Carlo Option Pricing Algorithm for Jump Diffusion Model
		with Correlation Companies // Black-Scholes Model [Black (1973)
		doi:10.1086/260062] is important to calculate option premium in
		the stock market. And variety of improved models are studied.
		In this package, I proposed functions in order to calculate
		normal and new Jump Diffusion Models [Kou (2002)
		doi:10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1086.166] by Monte Carlo Method. This
		package can be used for Computational Finance.
