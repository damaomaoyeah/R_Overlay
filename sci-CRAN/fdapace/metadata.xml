		Functional Data Analysis and Empirical Dynamics // Provides
		implementation of various methods of Functional Data Analysis
		(FDA) and Empirical Dynamics. The core of this package is
		Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), a key technique
		for functional data analysis, for sparsely or densely sampled
		random trajectories and time courses, via the Principal
		Analysis by Conditional Estimation (PACE) algorithm or
		numerical integration. PACE is useful for the analysis of data
		that have been generated by a sample of underlying (but usually
		not fully observed) random trajectories. It does not rely on
		pre-smoothing of trajectories, which is problematic if
		functional data are sparsely sampled. PACE provides options for
		functional regression and correlation, for Longitudinal Data
		Analysis, the analysis of stochastic processes from samples of
		realized trajectories, and for the analysis of underlying
		dynamics. The core computational algorithms are implemented
		using the 'Eigen' C++ library for numerical linear algebra and
		'RcppEigen' "glue".
