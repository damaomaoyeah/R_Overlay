		A Program to Estimate Animal Abundance and Density using Bayesian
		Spatially-Explicit Capture-Recapture Models // SPACECAP is a
		user-friendly software package for estimating animal densities
		using closed model capture-recapture sampling based on
		photographic captures using Bayesian spatially-explicit
		capture-recapture models. This approach offers advantage such
		as: substantially dealing with problems posed by individual
		heterogeneity in capture probabilities in conventional capture-
		recapture analyses. It also offers non-asymptotic inferences
		which are more appropriate for small samples of capture data
		typical of photo-capture studies.
