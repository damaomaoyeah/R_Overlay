		Building Diversity Models from Multiple Species Occupancy Models
		// Predictions of alpha diversity are fitted from presence
		data, first abundance is modeled from occupancy models and
		then, several diversity indices are calculated and finally GLM
		models are used to predict diversity in different environments
		and select priority areas.
