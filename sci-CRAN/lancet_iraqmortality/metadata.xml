		Surveys of Iraq Mortality Published in The Lancet // The Lancet
		has published two surveys (Roberts et al (2004) and Burnham et
		al (2006)) on Iraq mortality before and after the US-led
		invasion. This package serves three purposes. First, it
		includes a portion of the summary data related to the first
		study, both the raw .xls file distributed by the authors and a
		cleaned up R dataframe. Second, it provides simple functions
		for working with data from the second study. The authors have
		distributed this data only to selected researchers. Those
		researchers can use this package to work with that data more
		easily. Third, for researchers without such access, we provide
		a vignette which serves as a guided tour of some of the more
		interesting aspects of the data.
