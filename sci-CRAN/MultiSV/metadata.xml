		MultiSV: an R package for identification of structural variations
		in multiple populations based on whole genome resequencing //
		MultiSV is an R package for identification of structural
		variations in multiple populations based on whole genome
		resequencing. It fits linear mixed model and identifies
		structural variations in multiple populations using whole
		genome sequencing data. It could also be manipulated to use on
		RNA-seq data for differential gene expression (implementation
		in future releases). Main steps for analysis include generating
		read depth in bins using ComputeBinCounts. conversion of bins
		to MultiSV format using Bin2MultiSV. Finally, identification of
		structural variations using CallMultiSV.
