		A Comprehensive, General Purpose Population Genetics Analysis
		Package // Allows the calculation of both genetic diversity
		partition statistics, genetic differentiation statistics, and
		locus informativeness for ancestry assignment. It also provides
		users with various option to calculate bootstrapped 95\%
		confidence intervals both across loci, for pairwise population
		comparisons, and to plot these results interactively. Parallel
		computing capabilities and pairwise results without
		bootstrapping are provided. Also calculates F-statistics from
		Weir and Cockerham (1984). Various plotting features are
		provided, as well as Chi-square tests of genetic heterogeneity.
		Functionality for the calculation of various diversity
		parameters is possible for RAD-seq derived SNP data sets
		containing thousands of marker loci. A shiny application for
		the development of microsatellite multiplexes is also
		available.
