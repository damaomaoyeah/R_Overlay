		A Comprehensive, General Purpose Population Genetics Analysis
		Package // Allows the calculation of both genetic diversity
		partition statistics,genetic differentiation statistics and
		locus informativeness for ancestry assignment. It also provides
		users with various option to calculate bootstrapped 95%
		confidence intervals both across loci, for pairwise population
		comparisons and to plot these results interactively. V1.2 and
		up provides parallel computing capabilities and pairwise
		results without bootstrapping. Weir and Cockerham's 1984
		F-statistics are now also calculated. Various plotting features
		are also provided. Chi-square tests of genetic heterogeneity
		are also provided. Functionality for the calculation of various
		diversity parameters is also possible for RAD-seq derived SNP
		data sets containing thousands of marker loci. A shiny
		application for the development of microsatellite multiplexes
		is also available
