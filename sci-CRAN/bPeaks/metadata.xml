		bPeaks: an intuitive peak-calling strategy to detect
		transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data in small
		eukaryotic genomes // bPeaks is a simple approach to identify
		transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data. Our
		general philosophy is to provide an easy-to-use tool, well-
		adapted for small eukaryotic genomes ( 20 Mb). bPeaks uses a
		combination of 4 cutoffs (T1, T2, T3 and T4) to mimic "good
		peak" properties as described by biologists who visually
		inspect the ChIP-seq data on a genome browser. For yeast
		genomes, bPeaks calculates the proportion of peaks that fall in
		promoter sequences. These peaks are good candidates as
		transcription factor binding sites.
