		Tools for Preprocessing Combinations // Preprocessing is often
		the most time-consuming phase in data analysis and
		preprocessing transformations interdependent in unexpected
		ways. This package helps to make preprocessing faster and more
		effective. It provides an S4 framework for creating and
		evaluating preprocessing combinations for classification,
		clustering and outlier detection. The framework supports adding
		of user-defined preprocessors and preprocessing phases. Default
		preprocessors can be used for low variance removal, missing
		value imputation, scaling, outlier removal, noise smoothing,
		feature selection and class imbalance correction.
