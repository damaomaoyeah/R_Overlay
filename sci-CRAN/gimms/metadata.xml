		Download and Process GIMMS NDVI3g Data // We provide a set of
		functions to retrieve information about GIMMS NDVI3g files
		currently available online; download and re-arrange the bi-
		monthly datasets according to creation time; import downloaded
		files from native binary (ENVI) format directly into R based on
		the widely applied 'raster' package; extract accompanying
		quality flags and perform quality control; calculate monthly
		value composites (e.g. maximum value composites, MVC) from the
		bi-monthly input data; and derive long-term monotonous trends
		from the Mann-Kendall trend test, optionally featuring pre-
		whitening to account for lag-1 autocorrelation.
