		Approximate Gaussian processes Using the Fourier Basis //
		Routines for creating, manipulating, and performing Bayesian
		inference about Gaussian processes in one and two dimensions
		using the Fourier basis approximation: simulation and plotting
		of processes, calculation of coefficient variances, calculation
		of process density, coefficient proposals (for use in MCMC).
		It uses R environments to store GP objects as
		references/pointers.
