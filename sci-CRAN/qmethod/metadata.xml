		Analysis of Subjective Perspectives Using Q Methodology //
		Analysis of Q methodology, used to identify distinct
		perspectives existing within a group. This methodology is used
		across social, health and environmental sciences to understand
		diversity of attitudes, discourses, or decision-making styles
		(for more information, see http://qmethod.org). A single
		function runs the full analysis. Each step can be run
		separately using the corresponding functions: for automatic
		flagging of Q-sorts (manual flagging is optional), for
		statement scores, for distinguishing and consensus statements,
		and for general characteristics of the factors. Additional
		functions are available to import and export data, to print and
		plot, to import raw data from individual *.CSV files, and to
		make printable cards. The package also offers functions to
		print Q cards and to generate Q distributions for study
		administration. The package uses principal components and it
		allows manual or automatic flagging, a number of mathematical
		methods for rotation, and a number of correlation coefficients
		for the initial correlation matrix. See further details in the
		package documentation, and in the web pages below, which
		include a cookbook, guidelines for more advanced analysis (how
		to perform manual flagging or change the sign of factors), data
		management, and a beta graphical user interface for online and
		offline use.
