		Clinical Pharmacokinetics // The package cpk provides simplified
		clinical pharmacokinetic functions for dose regimen design and
		modification at the point-of-care. Currently, the following
		functions are available: (1) ttc.fn for target therapeutic
		concentration, (2) dr.fn for dose rate, (3) di.fn for dosing
		interval, (4) dm.fn for maintenance dose, (5) bc.ttc.fn for
		back calculation, (6) ar.fn for accumulation ratio, (7) dpo.fn
		for orally administered dose, (8) cmax.fn for peak
		concentration, (9) css.fn for steady-state concentration, (10)
		cmin.fn for trough,(11) ct.fn for concentration-time
		predictions, (12) dlcmax.fn for calculating loading dose based
		on drug's maximum concentration, (13) dlar.fn for calculating
		loading dose based on drug's accumulation ratio, and (14) R0.fn
		for calculating drug infusion rate. Reference: Linares O,

		application of clinical pharmacokinetics. J Pain Palliat Care
