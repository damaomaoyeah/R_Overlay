		Functions and Datasets to Accompany Hollander, Wolfe, and Chicken
		- Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Third Edition // Designed
		to replace the tables which were in the back of the first two
		editions of Hollander and Wolfe - Nonparametric Statistical
		Methods.  Exact procedures are performed when computationally
		possible.  Monte Carlo and Asymptotic procedures are performed
		otherwise.  For those procedures included in the base packages,
		our code simply provides a wrapper to standardize the output
		with the other procedures in the package.
