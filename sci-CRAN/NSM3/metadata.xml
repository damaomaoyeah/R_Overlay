		An R package to accompany Hollander, Wolfe, and Chicken -
		Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Third Edition // This
		package was designed to replace the tables which were in the
		back of the first two editions of Hollander and Wolfe -
		Nonparametric Statistical Methods.  Exact procedures are
		performed when computationally possible.  Monte Carlo and
		Asymptotic procedures are performed otherwise.  For those
		procedures included in the base packages, our code simply
		provides a wrapper to standardize the output with the other
		procedures in the package.
