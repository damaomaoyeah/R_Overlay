		Differential RNA Methylation Analysis with Quad-Negative-Binomial
		Model // We present QNB, a statistical approach for
		differential RNA methylation analysis with count-based small-
		sample sequencing data. The method is based on 4 independent
		negative binomial distributions, and with their variances and
		means linked by local regressions, respectively. Please don't
		hesitate to contact liulian19860905@163.com if you have any
		questions.
