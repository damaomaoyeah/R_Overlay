		Nonparametric Boundary Regression // A variety of functions for
		the best known and most innovative approaches to nonparametric
		boundary estimation. The selected methods are concerned with
		empirical, smoothed, unrestricted as well as constrained fits
		under both separate and multiple shape constraints. They cover
		robust approaches to outliers  as well as data envelopment
		techniques based on piecewise polynomials, splines, local
		linear fitting, extreme values and kernel smoothing. The
		package also seamlessly allows for Monte Carlo comparisons
		among these different estimation methods.  Its use is
		illustrated via a number of empirical applications and
		simulated examples.
