		Identifying the Pathways Regulated by LncRNA Sets of Interest //
		Identifies pathways synergisticly regulated by the interested
		lncRNA(long non-coding RNA) sets based on a lncRNA-
		mRNA(messenger RNA) interaction network. 1) The lncRNA-mRNA
		interaction network was built from the protein-protein
		interactions and the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression relationships in
		28 RNA-Seq data sets. 2) The interested lncRNAs can be mapped
		into networks as seed nodes and a random walk strategy will be
		performed to evaluate the rate of each coding genes influenced
		by the seed lncRNAs. 3) Pathways regulated by the lncRNA set
		will be evaluated by a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic as
		an ES Score. 4) The p value and false discovery rate value will
		also be calculated through a permutation analysis. 5) The
		running score of each pathway can be plotted and the heat map
		of each pathway can also be plotted if an expression profile is
		provided. 6) The rank and scores of the gene list of each
		pathway can be printed.
