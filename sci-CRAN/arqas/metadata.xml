		Application in R for Queueing Analysis and Simulation // Provides
		functions to compute the main characteristics of the following
		queueing models: M/M/1, M/M/s, M/M/1/k, M/M/s/k, M/M/1/Inf/H,
		M/ M/s/Inf/H, M/M/s/Inf/H with Y replacements, M/M/Inf, Open
		Jackson Networks and Closed Jackson Networks. Moreover, it is
		also possible to simulate similar queueing models with any type
		of arrival or service distribution: G/ G/1, G/G/s, G/G/1/k,
		G/G/s/k, G/G/1/Inf/H, G/G/s/Inf/H, G/G/s/Inf/H with Y
		replacements, Open Networks and Closed Networks. Finally,
		contains functions for fit data to a statistic distribution.
