		Optimized GWAS cohort subset selection for resequencing studies
		// This package contains functionality to select a subsample of
		a genotyped cohort e.g. from a GWAS that is preferential for
		resequencing under the assumtion that causal variants share a
		haplotype with the risk allele of associated variants. The
		subsample is selected such that is contains risk alleles at
		maximum frequency for all SNPs specified. Phentoypes can also
		be included as additional variables to obtain a higher fraction
		of extreme phenotypes. An arbitrary number of SNPs and/or
		phentoypes can be specified for enrichment in a single
		subsample.
