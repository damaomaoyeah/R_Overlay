		Useful functions for visual word recognition research //
		Functions and data for use in visual word recognition research:
		Computation of neighbors (Hamming and Levenshtein distances),
		average distances to neighbors (e.g., OLD20), and Coltheart's
		N. Also includes the LD1NN algorithm to detect bias in the
		composition of a lexical decision task. Most of the functions
		support parallel execution. Supplies wordlists for several
		languages. Uses the string distance functions from the
		stringdist package by Mark van der Loo.
