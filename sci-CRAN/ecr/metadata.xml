		Evolutionary Computing in R // Provides a powerful framework for
		evolutionary computing in R. The user can easily construct
		powerful evolutionary algorithms for tackling both single- and
		multi-objective problems by plugging in different predefined
		evolutionary building blocks, e. g., operators for mutation,
		recombination and selection with just a few lines of code. Your
		problem cannot be easily solved with a standard EA which works
		on real-valued vectors, permutations or binary strings? No
		problem, 'ecr' has been developed with that in mind. Extending
		the framework with own operators is also possible. Additionally
		there are various comfort functions, like monitoring, logging
		and more.
