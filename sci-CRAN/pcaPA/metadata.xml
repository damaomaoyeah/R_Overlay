		Parallel Analysis for Ordinal and Numeric Data using Polychoric
		and Pearson Correlations with S3 Classes // A set of functions
		to perform parallel analysis for principal components analysis
		intended mainly for large data sets. It performs a parallel
		analysis of continuous, ordered (including dichotomous/binary
		as a special case) or mixed type of data associated with a
		principal components analysis. Polychoric correlations among
		ordered variables, Pearson correlations among continuous
		variables and polyserial correlation between mixed type
		variables (one ordered and one continuous) are used. Whenever
		the use of polyserial or polychoric correlations yields a non
		positive definite correlation matrix, the resulting matrix is
		transformed into the nearest positive definite matrix. This is
		a continued work based on a previous version developed at the
		Colombian Institute for the evaluation of education - ICFES.
