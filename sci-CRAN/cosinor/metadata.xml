		Tools for estimating and predicting the cosinor model // cosinor
		is a set of simple functions that transforms longitudinal data
		to estimate the cosinor linear model as described in Tong
		(1976). Methods are given to summarize the mean, amplitude and
		acrophase, to predict the mean annual outcome value, and to
		test the coefficients.
