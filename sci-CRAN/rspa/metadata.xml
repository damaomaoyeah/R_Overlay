		Adapt Numerical Records to Fit (in)Equality Restrictions // Based
		on (optionally sparse) quadratic optimization with the main
		algorithms implemented in C. Includes features for easy
		processing of many (smaller) records. The algorithm has been
		tested on fairly large optimization problems with up to a few
		million variables and several hundred thousand restrictions.
