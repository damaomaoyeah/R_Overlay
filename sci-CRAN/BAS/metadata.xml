		Bayesian Model Averaging using Bayesian Adaptive Sampling //
		Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models using
		stochastic or deterministic sampling without replacement from
		posterior distributions.  Prior distributions on coefficients
		are from Zellner's g-prior or mixtures of g-priors
		corresponding to the Zellner-Siow Cauchy Priors or the Liang et
		al hyper-g priors (JASA 2008). Other model selection criterian
		include AIC and BIC. Sampling probabilities may be updated
		based on the sampled models.  Allows uniform or beta-binomial
		prior distributions on models.
