		Bayesian Model Averaging using Bayesian Adaptive Sampling //
		Package for Bayesian Model Averaging in linear models and
		generalized linear models using stochastic or deterministic
		sampling without replacement from posterior distributions.
		Prior distributions on coefficients are from Zellner's g-prior
		or mixtures of g-priors corresponding to the Zellner-Siow
		Cauchy Priors or the Liang et al hyper-g priors (JASA 2008) or
		mixtures of g-priors in GLMS of Li and Clyde 2015. Other model
		selection criteria include AIC and BIC. Sampling probabilities
		may be updated based on the sampled models using Sampling w/out
		Replacement or an MCMC algorithm samples models using the BAS
		tree structure as an efficient hash table. Allows uniform or
		beta-binomial prior distributions on models, and may force
		variables to always be included.
