		R interface to the Vowpal Wabbit // R interface to Vowpal Wabbit
		fast out-of-core learning system The Vowpal Wabbit (VW) project
		is a fast out-of-core learning system sponsored by Yahoo!
		Research and written by John Langford along with a number of
		contributors. . There are two ways to have a fast learning
		algorithm: (a) start with a slow algorithm and speed it up, or
		(b) build an intrinsically fast learning algorithm. This
		project is about approach (b), and it has reached a state where
		it may be useful to others as a platform for research and
		experimentation. . There are several optimization algorithms
		available with the baseline being sparse gradient descent (GD)
		on a loss function (several are available). The code should be
		easily usable. Its only external dependence is on the Boost
		library, which is often installed by default. . This R package
		does not include the distributed computing implementation of
		the cluster/ directory of the upstream sources.  Use of the
		software as a network servie is also not directly supported as
		the aim is a simpler direct call from R for validation and
		comparison.
