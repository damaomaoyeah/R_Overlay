		Identifying unique multilocus genotypes where genotyping error
		and missing data may be present // This package provides tools
		for the identification of unique of multilocus genotypes when
		both genotyping error and missing data may be present. The
		package is targeted at those working with large datasets and
		databases containing multiple samples of each individual, a
		situation that is common in conservation genetics, and
		particularly in non-invasive wildlife sampling applications.
		Functions explicitly incorporate missing data, and can tolerate
		allele mismatches created by genotyping error. If you use this
		tool, please cite the package using the journal article in
		Molecular Ecology Resources (Galpern et al., 2012).  Please use
		citation('allelematch') to find this. Due to changing CRAN
		policy, and the size and compile time of the vignettes, they
		can no longer be distributed with this package.  Please contact
		the package primary author, or visit the allelematch site for a
		complete vignette
		(http://nricaribou.cc.umanitoba.ca/allelematch/).  For users
		with access to academic literature, tutorial material is also
		available as supplementary material to the article describing
		this software.
