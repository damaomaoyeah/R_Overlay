		A Fast, Easy-to-use Tool for Manipulating Tables in Databases and
		A Wrapper of MADlib // R interface of Pivotal Data Fabrics
		running on PostgreSQL or Pivotal (Greenplum and HAWQ) database
		with parallel and distributed computation ability for big data
		analytics. PivotalR is a package that enables users of R to
		interact with the Pivotal (Greenplum) Database as well as
		Pivotal HD/HAWQ for Big Data analytics. It does so by providing
		an interface to the operations on tables/views in the database.
		These operations are almost the same as those of data.frame.
		Thus the users of R do not need to learn SQL when they operate
		on the objects in the database. It also provides a wrapper for
		MADlib, which is an open-source library for parallel and
		scalable in-database analytics.
