		Characterization of functional genes in complex microbial
		communities using tiling DNA microarrays // This package is
		intended for processing the output from functional gene tiling
		DNA microarray experiments. It produces hybridization pattern
		plots for each gene on the array, and statistics for each gene
		including mean probe intensity, median probe intensity, bright
		probe fraction, bright segment length dependent score, bright
		probe mean intensity, and bright probe median intensity. Output
		is generated in order of bright segment length dependent score
		in both a latex/eps format and tab-delimited text file. The
		package works in two modes: single array, and comparison of two
		arrays. Array comparison includes array comparison statistics:
		median of logarithm of one array probe divided by its
		counterpart on the other array, median absolute deviation of
		that value, and the binomial test to see whether the genes are
		equally abundant in both arrays.
