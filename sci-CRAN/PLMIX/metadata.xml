		Bayesian Analysis of Finite Mixtures of Plackett-Luce Models for
		Partial Rankings/Orderings // Fit finite mixtures of Plackett-
		Luce models for partial top rankings/orderings within the
		Bayesian framework. It provides MAP point estimates via EM
		algorithm and posterior MCMC simulations via Gibbs Sampling. It
		also fits MLE as a special case of the noninformative Bayesian
		analysis with vague priors.
