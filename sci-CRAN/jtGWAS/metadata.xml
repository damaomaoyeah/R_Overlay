		Efficient Jonckheere-Terpstra Test Statistics // The core of this
		'Rcpp' based package is a function to compute standardized
		Jonckheere-Terpstra test statistics for large numbers of
		dependent and independent variables, e.g., genome-wide
		analysis. It implements 'OpenMP', allowing the option of
		computing on multiple threads. Supporting functions are also
		provided to calculate p-values and summarize results.
