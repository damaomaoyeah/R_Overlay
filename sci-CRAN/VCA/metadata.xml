		Variance Component Analysis // ANOVA-type estimation (prediction)
		of random effects and variance components in linear mixed
		models, is implemented. Random models, a sub-set of mixed
		models, can be fit applying a Variance Component Analysis
		(VCA). This is a special type of analysis frequently used in
		verifying the precision performance of diagnostics. The
		Satterthwaite approximation of the total degrees of freedom is
		implemented. There are several functions for extracting, random
		effects, fixed effects, variance-covariance matrices of random
		and fixed effects. Residuals can be extracted as raw,
		standardized and studentized residuals. Additionally, a
		variability chart is implemented for visualizing the
		variability in sub-classes emerging from an experimental design
		('varPlot').
