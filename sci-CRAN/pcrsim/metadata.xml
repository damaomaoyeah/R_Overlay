		Simulation of the Forensic DNA Process // Simulate the forensic
		DNA process: generate random or fixed DNA profiles, create
		forensic samples including mixtures of diploid and haploid
		cells, simulate DNA extraction, normalization, degradation,
		amplification including stutters and inter-locus balance, and
		capillary electrophoresis. DNA profiles are visualized as
		electropherograms and saved in tables. The command pcrsim()
		opens up a graphical user interface which allow the user to
		create projects, to enter, load, and save parameters required
		for the simulation. The simulation is transparent and the
		parameters used in each step of the simulation can be viewed in
		the result tables.
