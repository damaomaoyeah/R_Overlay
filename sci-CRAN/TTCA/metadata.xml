		Transcript Time Course Analysis // The analysis of microarray
		time series promises a deeper insight into the dynamics of the
		cellular response following stimulation. A common observation
		in this type of data is that some genes respond with quick,
		transient dynamics, while other genes change their expression
		slowly over time. The existing methods for the detection of
		significant expression dynamics often fail when the expression
		dynamics show a large heterogeneity, and often cannot cope with
		irregular and sparse measurements. The method proposed here is
		specifically designed for the analysis of perturbation
		responses. It combines different scores to capture fast and
		transient dynamics as well as slow expression changes, and
		deals with low replicate numbers and irregular sampling times.
		The results are given in the form of tables linked to figures.
		These allow to quickly recognize the relevance of detection, to
		identify possible false positives and to distinguish between
		changes in the early and later expression. An extension of the
		method allows the analysis of the expression dynamics of
		functional groups of genes, providing a quick overview of the
		cellular response. The performance of this package was tested
		on microarray data derived from lung cancer cells stimulated
		with epidermal growth factor. See publication "TTCA: An R
		package for the identification of differentially expressed
		genes in time course microarray data".
