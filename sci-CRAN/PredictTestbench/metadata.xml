		Test Bench for Comparison of Data Prediction Models // Provides a
		Testbench for comparison of prediction models. This package is
		inspired from 'imputeTestbench' package
		https://cran.r-project.org/package=imputeTestbench. It compares
		prediction models with reference to RMSE, MAE or MAPE
		parameters. It allows to add new proposed methods to test bench
		and to compare with other methods. The function
		'prediction_append()' allows to add multiple numbers of methods
		to the existing methods available in test bench.
