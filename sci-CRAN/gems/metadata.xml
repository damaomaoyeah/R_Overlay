		Generalized Multistate Simulation Model // Simulate and analyze
		multistate models with general hazard functions. gems provides
		functionality for the preparation of hazard functions and
		parameters, simulation from a general multistate model and
		predicting future events. The multistate model is not required
		to be a Markov model and may take the history of previous
		events into account. In the basic version, it allows to
		simulate from transition-specific hazard function, whose
		parameters are multivariable normally distributed.
