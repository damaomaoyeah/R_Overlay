		Generalized multistate simulation model // This package allows to
		simulating and analyzing multistate models with general hazard
		functions. It provides functionality for the preparation of
		hazard functions and parameters, simulation from a general
		multistate model and predicting future events. The multistate
		model is not required to be a Markov model and may take the
		history of previous events into account. In the basic version,
		it allows to simulate from transition-specific hazard function,
		whose parameters are multivariable normally distributed.
