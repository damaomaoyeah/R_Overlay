		An Implementation of Bat Algorithm in R // A nature-inspired
		metaheuristic algorithm based on the echolocation behavior of
		microbats that uses frequency tuning to optimize problems in
		both continuous and discrete dimensions. This R package makes
		it easy to implement the standard bat algorithm on any user-
		supplied function. The algorithm was first developed by Xin-She
		Yang in 2010 (DOI:10.1007/978-3-642-12538-6_6,
		DOI:10.1109/CINTI.2014.7028669).
