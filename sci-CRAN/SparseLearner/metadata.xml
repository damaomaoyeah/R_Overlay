		Sparse Learning Algorithms Using a LASSO-Type Penalty for
		Coefficient Estimation and Model Prediction // Coefficient
		estimation and model prediction based on the LASSO sparse
		learning algorithm and its improved versions such as Bolasso,
		bootstrap ranking LASSO, two-stage hybrid LASSO and others.
		These estimation procedures are applied in the fields of
		variable selection, graphical modeling and forecasting.
