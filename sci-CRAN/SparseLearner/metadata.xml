		Sparse Learning Algorithms Using a LASSO-Type Penalty for
		Coefficient Estimation and Model Prediction // Performs the
		LASSO-type sparse learning algorithm and its improved versions
		such as Bolasso, bootstrap ranking LASSO, two-stage hybrid
		LASSO and so on for coefficient estimation and model
		prediction. These estimation procedures are applied in the
		fields of variable selection, graphical modeling and model
		prediction.
