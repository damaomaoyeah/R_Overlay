		Wombling Computation // Analyses individually geo-referenced
		multilocus genotypes for the inferences of genetic boundaries
		between populations. It is based on the wombling method that
		estimates the systemic function by looking for the local
		variation of the allele frequencies. The systemic function
		estimation is based on the local polynomial regression, and a
		binomial test assess the significance of boundaries. The method
		applies to codominant or dominant markers and allows for
		missing data.
