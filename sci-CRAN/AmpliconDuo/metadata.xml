		Statistical Analysis Of Amplicon Data Of The Same Sample To
		Identify Artefacts // Increasingly powerful techniques for
		high-throughput sequencing open the possibility to
		comprehensively characterize microbial communities, including
		rare species. However, a still unresolved issue are the
		substantial error rates in the experimental process generating
		these sequences. To overcome these limitations we propose an
		approach, where each sample is split and the same amplification
		and sequencing protocol is applied to both halves. This
		procedure should allow to detect likely PCR and sequencing
		artifacts, and true rare species by comparison of the results
		of both parts. The AmpliconDuo package, whereas amplicon duo
		from here on refers to the two amplicon data sets of a split
		sample, is intended to help interpret the obtained read
		frequency distribution across split samples, and to filter the
		false positive reads.
