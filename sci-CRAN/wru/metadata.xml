		Who Are You? Bayesian Prediction of Racial Category Using Surname
		and Geolocation // This open-source software package enables
		researchers to predict individual ethnicity using his/her
		surname, geolocation, and other attributes such as gender and
		age. The method utilizes the Bayes' rule to compute the
		posterior probability of each racial category for any given
		individual voter. The package implements methods described in
		Imai and Khanna (2016) DOI:10.1093/pan/mpw001.
