		FCROS to search for differentially expressed genes and to detect
		recurrent chromosomal copy number aberrations. // A fold change
		rank ordering statistics method is presented to search for
		differentially expressed genes and to detect recurrent
		chromosomal copy number aberrations. This method may be useful
		for high-throughput biological data (microarray, sequencing,
		...). Probabilities are associated with genes in the dataset
		and there is no problem of multiple tests when using this
		method.
