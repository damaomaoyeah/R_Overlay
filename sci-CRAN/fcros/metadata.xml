		A Method to Search for Differentially Expressed Genes and to
		Detect Recurrent Chromosomal Copy Number Aberrations // A fold
		change rank ordering statistics method is presented to search
		for differentially expressed genes and to detect recurrent
		chromosomal copy number aberrations. This method may be useful
		for high-throughput biological data (microarray, sequencing,
		...). Probabilities are associated with genes/probes in the
		dataset and there is no problem of multiple tests when using
		this method. For aCGH data, segmentation results are obtained
		by merging the significant probes detected.
