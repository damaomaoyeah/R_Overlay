		A Method to Search for Differentially Expressed Genes and to
		Detect Recurrent Chromosomal Copy Number Aberrations // A fold
		change rank based method is presented to search for genes with
		changing expression and to detect recurrent chromosomal copy
		number aberrations. This method may be useful for high-
		throughput biological data (micro-array, sequencing, ...).
		Probabilities are associated with genes or probes in the data
		set and there is no problem of multiple tests when using this
		method. For array-based comparative genomic hybridization data,
		segmentation results are obtained by merging the significant
		probes detected.
