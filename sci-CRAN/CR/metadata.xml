		Power Calculation for Weighted Log-Rank Tests in Cure Rate Models
		// This package contains R-functions to perform power
		calculation in a group sequential clinical trial with censored
		survival data and possibly unequal patient allocation between
		treatment and control groups. The fuctions can also be used to
		determine the study duration in a clinical trial with censored
		survival data as the sum of the accrual duration, which
		determines the sample size in a traditional sense, and the
		follow-up duration, which more or less controls the number of
		events to be observed. This package also contains R functions
		and methods to display the computed results.
