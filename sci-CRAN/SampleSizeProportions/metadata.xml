		Calculating sample size requirements when estimating the
		difference between two binomial proportions // A set of R
		functions for calculating sample size requirements using three
		different Bayesian criteria in the context of designing an
		experiment to estimate the difference between two binomial
		proportions. Functions for calculation of required sample sizes
		for the Average Length Criterion, the Average Coverage
		Criterion and the Worst Outcome Criterion in the context of
		binomial observations are provided. In all cases, estimation of
		the difference between two binomial proportions is considered.
		Functions for both the fully Bayesian and the mixed
		Bayesian/likelihood approaches are provided.
