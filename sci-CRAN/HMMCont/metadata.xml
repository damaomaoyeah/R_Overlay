		Hidden Markov Model for Continuous Observations Processes // The
		package includes the functions designed to analyse continuous
		observations processes with the Hidden Markov Model approach.
		They include Baum-Welch and Viterbi algorithms and additional
		visualisation functions. The observations are assumed to have
		Gaussian distribution and to be weakly stationary processes.
		The package was created for analyses of financial time series,
		but can also be applied to any continuous observations
		processes.
