		Differential Geometric Least Angle Regression // Differential
		geometric least angle regression method for fitting sparse
		generalized linear models. In this version of the package, the
		user can fit models specifying Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial,
		Gamma and Inverse Gaussian family. Furthermore, several link
		functions can be used to model the relationship between the
		conditional expected value of the response variable and the
		linear predictor. The solution curve can be computed using an
		efficient predictor-corrector or a cyclic coordinate descent
		algorithm, as described in the paper linked to via the URL
		below.
