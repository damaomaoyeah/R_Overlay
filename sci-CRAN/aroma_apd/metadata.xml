		A probe-level data file format used by aroma.affymetrix
		[DEPRECATED] // THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. (The (in-
		house) APD file format was initially developed to store
		Affymetrix probe-level data, e.g. normalized CEL intensities.
		Chip types can be added to APD file and similar to methods in
		the affxparser package, this package provides methods to read
		APDs organized by units (probesets).  In addition, the probe
		elements can be arranged optimally such that the elements are
		guaranteed to be read in order when, for instance, data is read
		unit by unit.  This speeds up the read substantially.  This
		package is supporting the Aroma framework and should not be
		used elsewhere.)
