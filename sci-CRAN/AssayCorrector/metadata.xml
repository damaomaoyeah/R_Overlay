		Detection and Correction of Spatial Bias in HTS Screens // (1)
		Detects plate-specific spatial bias by identifying rows and
		columns of all plates of the assay affected by this bias
		(following the results of the Mann-Whitney U test) as well as
		assay-specific spatial bias by identifying well locations
		(i.e., well positions scanned across all plates of a given
		assay) affected by this bias (also following the results of the
		Mann-Whitney U test); (2) Allows one to correct plate-specific
		spatial bias using either the additive or multiplicative PMP
		(Partial Mean Polish) method (the most appropriate spatial bias
		model can be either specified by the user or determined by the
		program following the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-
		sample test) to correct the assay measurements as well as to
		correct assay-specific spatial bias by carrying out robust
		Z-scores within each plate of the assay and then traditional
		Z-scores across well locations.
