		Sample Size Calculations for Longitudinal Data // The longpower
		package contains functions for computing power and sample size
		for linear models of longitudinal data based on the formula due
		to Liu and Liang (1997) and Diggle et al (2002). Either formula
		is expressed in terms of marginal model or Generalized
		Estimating Equations (GEE) parameters. This package contains
		functions which translate pilot mixed effect model parameters
		(e.g. random intercept and/or slope) into marginal model
		parameters so that the formulas of Diggle et al or Liu and
		Liang formula can be applied to produce sample size
		calculations for two sample longitudinal designs assuming known
		variance.
