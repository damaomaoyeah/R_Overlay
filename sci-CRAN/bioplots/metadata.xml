		Visualization of Overlapping Results with Heatmap //
		Visualization of complex biological datasets is essential to
		understand complementary spects of biology in big data era. In
		addition, analyzing of multiple datasets enables to understand
		biologcal processes deeply and accurately. Multiple datasets
		produce multiple analysis results, and these overlappings are
		usually visualized in Venn diagram. bioplots is a tiny R
		package that generates a heatmap to visualize overlappings
		instead of using Venn diagram.
