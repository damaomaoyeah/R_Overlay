		Protocol Inspection and State Machine Analysis // The PRISMA
		package is capable of loading and processing huge text corpora
		processed with the sally toolbox (http://www.mlsec.org/sally/).
		sally acts as a very fast preprocessor which splits the text
		files into tokens or n-grams. These output files can then be
		read with the PRISMA package which applies testing-based token
		selection and has some replicate-aware, highly tuned non-
		negative matrix factorization and principal component analysis
		implementation which allows the processing of very big data
		sets even on desktop machines.
