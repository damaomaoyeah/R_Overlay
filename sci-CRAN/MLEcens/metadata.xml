		Computation of the MLE for bivariate (interval) censored data //
		This package contains functions to compute the nonparametric
		maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the bivariate
		distribution of (X,Y), when realizations of (X,Y) cannot be
		observed directly.  To be more precise, we consider the
		situation where we observe a set of rectangles that are known
		to contain the unobservable realizations of (X,Y). We compute
		the MLE based on such a set of rectangles.  The methods can
		also be used for univariate censored data (see data set
		'cosmesis'), and for censored data with competing risks (see
		data set 'menopause').  We also provide functions to visualize
		the observed data and the MLE.
