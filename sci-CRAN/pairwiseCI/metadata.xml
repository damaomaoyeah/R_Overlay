		Confidence intervals for two sample comparisons // Calculation of
		the parametric, nonparametric confidence intervals for the
		difference or ratio of location parameters, nonparametric
		confidence interval for the Behrens-Fisher problem and for the
		difference, ratio and odds-ratio of binomial proportions for
		comparison of independent samples. The package provides common
		wrapper functions to split data sets and apply confidence
		intervals or tests to these subsets. A by statement allows
		calculation of CI separately for the levels of further factors.
		CI are not adjusted for multiplicity.
