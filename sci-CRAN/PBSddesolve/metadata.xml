		Solver for Delay Differential Equations // This package solves
		systems of delay differential equations. by interfacing
		numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood , with
		contributions by Benjamin J. Cairns. These numerical routines
		first appeared in Simon Wood's solv95 program. This package
		includes a vignette and a complete user's guide. 'PBSddesolve'
		originally appeared on CRAN under the name 'ddesolve'. That
		version is no longer supported. The current name emphasizes a
		close association with other PBS packages, particularly
		'PBSmodelling'.
