		Spiked Eigenvalue Test for Pathway data // Tests gene expression
		data from a biological pathway for biologically meaningful
		differences in the eigenstructure between two classes.
		Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis that the two
		classes' leading eigenvalues and sums of eigenvalues are equal.
		A pathway's leading eigenvalue arguably represents the total
		variability due to variability in pathway activity, while the
		sum of all its eigenvalues represents the variability due to
		pathway activity and to other, unregulated causes.
		Implementation of the method described in Danaher (2015),
		"Covariance-based analyses of biological pathways".
