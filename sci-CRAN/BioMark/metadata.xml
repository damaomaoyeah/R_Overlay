		Find Biomarkers in Two-Class Discrimination Problems // Variable
		selection methods are provided for several classification
		methods: the lasso/elastic net, PCLDA, PLSDA, and several
		t-tests. Two approaches for selecting cutoffs can be used, one
		based on the stability of model coefficients under
		perturbation, and the other on higher criticism.
