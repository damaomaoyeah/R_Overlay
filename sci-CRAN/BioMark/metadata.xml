		Find biomarkers in two-class discrimination problems // The
		package provides biomarker selection for several classification
		methods: the lasso/elastic net, PCLDA, PLSDA, and several
		t-tests. Two approaches are provided, one based on the
		stability of model coefficients under perturbation, and the
		other on higher criticism.
