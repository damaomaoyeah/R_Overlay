		Data Supporting the 'VGAM' Package // Data sets to accompany the
		VGAM package and the book "Vector Generalized Linear and
		Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015).
		These are used to illustrate vector generalized linear and
		additive models (VGLMs/VGAMs), and associated models (Reduced-
		Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Row-Column Interaction Models,
		and constrained and unconstrained ordination models in
		ecology).
