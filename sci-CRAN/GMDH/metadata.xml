		Short Term Forecasting via GMDH-Type Neural Network Algorithms //
		Group method of data handling (GMDH) - type neural network
		algorithm is the heuristic self-organization method for
		modelling the complex systems. In this package, GMDH-type
		neural network algorithms are applied to make short term
		forecasting for a univariate time series.
