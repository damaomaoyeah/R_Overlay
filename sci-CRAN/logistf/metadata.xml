		Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression // Fit a logistic
		regression model using Firth's bias reduction method,
		equivalent to penalization of the log-likelihood by the
		Jeffreys prior. Confidence intervals for regression
		coefficients can be computed by penalized profile likelihood.
		Firth's method was proposed as ideal solution to the problem of
		separation in logistic regression. If needed, the bias
		reduction can be turned off such that ordinary maximum
		likelihood logistic regression is obtained.
