		Exact Multinomial Test: Goodness-of-Fit Test for Discrete
		Multivariate data // The package provides functions to carry
		out a Goodness-of-fit test for discrete multivariate data. It
		is tested if a given observation is likely to have occurred
		under the assumption of an ab-initio model. A p-value can be
		calculated using different distance measures between observed
		and expected frequencies. A Monte Carlo method is provided to
		make the package capable of solving high-dimensional problems.
