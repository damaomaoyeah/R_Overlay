		Meta-analysis for Classification Data and Correction to Imperfect
		Reference // This package allows doing meta-analysis for
		primary studies with classification outcomes in order to
		evaluate systematically the accuracies of classifiers, namely,
		the diagnostic tests. It provides functions to fit the
		bivariate model of Reitsma et al.(2005). Moreover, if the
		reference employed in the classification process isn't a gold
		standard, its deficit can be detected and its influence to the
		underestimation of the diagnostic test's accuracy can be
		corrected, as described in Botella et al.(2013).
