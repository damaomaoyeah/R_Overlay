		Constrained, Covariance-Matching Constrained and Universal Point
		or Block Kriging // Provides functions for efficient
		computations of nonlinear spatial predictions with local change
		of support. This package supplies functions for tow-dimensional
		spatial interpolation by constrained, covariance-matching
		constrained and universal (external drift) kriging for points
		or block of any shape for data with a nonstationary mean
		function and an isotropic weakly stationary variogram. The
		linear spatial interpolation methods, constrained and
		covariance-matching constrained kriging, provide approximately
		unbiased prediction for nonlinear target values under change of
		support. This package extends the range of geostatistical tools
		available in R and provides a veritable alternative to
		conditional simulation for nonlinear spatial prediction
		problems with local change of support.
