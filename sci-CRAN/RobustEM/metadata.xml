		Robust Mixture Modeling Fitted via Spatial-EM Algorithm for
		Model-Based Clustering and Outlier Detection // The Spatial-EM
		is a new robust EM algorithm for the finite mixture learning
		procedures. The algorithm utilizes median- based location and
		rank-based scatter estimators to replace sample mean and sample
		covariance matrix in each M step, hence enhancing stability and
		robustness of the algorithm. To understand more about this
		algorithm, read the article ''Yu, K., Dang, X., Bart Jr, H. and
		Chen, Y. (2015). Robust Model- based Learning via Spatial-EM
		Algorithm. IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,
		27(6), 1670-1682. doi:10.1109/TKDE.2014.2373355''.
