		Simulation of Study Data // Simulates data sets in order to
		explore modeling techniques or better understand data
		generating processes. The user specifies a set of relationships
		between covariates, and generates data based on these
		specifications. The final data sets can represent data from
		randomized control trials, repeated measure (longitudinal)
		designs, and cluster randomized trials. Missingness can be
		generated using various mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, NMAR).
