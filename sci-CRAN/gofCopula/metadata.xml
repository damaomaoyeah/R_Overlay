		Goodness-of-Fit Tests for Copulae // Several GoF tests for
		Copulae are provided. A new hybrid test is implemented which
		supports all of the individual tests. Estimation methods for
		the margins are provided. All the tests support parameter
		estimation and predefined values. The parameters are estimated
		by pseudo maximum likelihood but if it fails the estimation
		switches automatically to inversion of Kendall's tau. All the
		tests support automatized parallelization of the bootstrapping
		tasks.
