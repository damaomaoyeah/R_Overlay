		Adaptive Mixed LASSO // This package implements the adaptive
		mixed lasso (AML) method proposed by Wang et al.(2011).  AML
		applies adaptive lasso penalty to a large number of predictors,
		thus producing a sparse model, while accounting for the
		population structure in the linear mixed model framework.  The
		package here is primarily designed for application to genome
		wide association studies or genomic prediction in plant
		breeding populations, though it could be applied to other
		settings of linear mixed models.
