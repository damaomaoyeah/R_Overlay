		Bundle Methods for Regularized Risk Minimization Package //
		Bundle methods for minimization of convex and non-convex risk
		under L1 or L2 regularization. Implements the algorithm
		proposed by Teo et al. (JMLR 2010) as well as the extension
		proposed by Do and Artieres (JMLR 2012). The package comes with
		lot of loss functions for machine learning which make it
		powerful for big data analysis. The applications includes:
		structured prediction, linear SVM, multi-class SVM, f-beta
		optimization, ROC optimization, ordinal regression, quantile
		regression, epsilon insensitive regression, least mean square,
		logistic regression, least absolute deviation regression (see
		package examples), etc... all with L1 and L2 regularization.
