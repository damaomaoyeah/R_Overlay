		Procedures for Psychological, Psychometric, and Personality
		Research // A general purpose toolbox for personality,
		psychometrics and experimental psychology.   Functions are
		primarily for multivariate analysis and scale construction
		using factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster
		analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide
		basic descriptive statistics. Item Response Theory is done
		using  factor analysis of tetrachoric and polychoric
		correlations. Functions for analyzing data at multi-levels
		include within and between group statistics, including
		correlations and factor analysis.   Functions for simulating
		particular item and test structures are included. Several
		functions serve as a useful front end for structural equation
		modeling.  Graphical displays of path diagrams, factor analysis
		and structural equation models are created using basic
		graphics. Some of the functions are written to support a book
		on psychometrics as well as publications in personality
		research. For more information, see the personality-
		project.org/r webpage.
