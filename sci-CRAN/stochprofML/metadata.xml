		Stochastic Profiling using Maximum Likelihood Estimation // This
		is an R package accompanying the paper "Parameterizing cell-to-
		cell regulatory heterogeneities via stochastic transcriptional
		profiles" by Sameer S Bajikar, Christiane Fuchs, Andreas
		Roller, Fabian J Theis and Kevin A Janes (PNAS 2014, 111(5),
		E626-635). In this paper, we measure expression profiles from
		small heterogeneous populations of cells, where each cell is
		assumed to be from a mixture of lognormal distributions. We
		perform maximum likelihood estimation in order to infer the
		mixture ratio and the parameters of these lognormal
		distributions from the cumulated expression measurements.
