		2D and 3D Hive Plots for R // HiveR creates and plots 2D and 3D
		hive plots. Hive plots are a unique method of displaying
		networks of many types in which node properties are mapped to
		axes using meaningful properties rather than being arbitrarily
		positioned.  The hive plot concept was invented by Martin
		Krzywinski at the Genome Science Center (www.hiveplot.net/).
		Keywords: networks, food webs, linnet, systems biology,
		bioinformatics.
