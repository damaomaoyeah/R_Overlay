		Convert Binary Species Range Maps into Continuous Surfaces Based
		on Distance to Range Edge // Contains functions to convert
		binary (presence-absence) expert species range maps (like those
		found in a field guide) into continuous surfaces based on
		distance to range edge.  These maps can then be used in species
		distribution models such as Maximum Entropy (Phillips 2008
		DOI:10.1111/j.0906-7590.2008.5203.x) using additional
		information (such as point occurrence data) to refine the
		expert map.
