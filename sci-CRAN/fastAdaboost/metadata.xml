		a Fast Implementation of Adaboost // Implements Adaboost based on
		C++ backend code. This is blazingly fast and especially useful
		for large, in memory data sets. The package uses decision trees
		as weak classifiers. Once the classifiers have been trained,
		they can be used to predict new data. Currently, we support
		only binary classification tasks. The package implements the
		Adaboost.M1 algorithm and the real Adaboost(SAMME.R) algorithm.
