		Simulate from ODE-Based Population PK/PD and Systems Pharmacology
		Models // Facilitates simulation from hierarchical, ordinary
		differential equation (ODE) based models typically employed in
		drug development. A model specification file is created
		consisting of R and C++ code that is parsed, compiled, and
		dynamically loaded into the R session. Input data are passed in
		and simulated data are returned as R objects.  A dosing event
		engine allows interventions (bolus and infusion) to be managed
		separately from the model code. Differential equations are
		solved with the 'DLSODA' routine in 'ODEPACK'
		(https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/odepack/).
