		Continuous Time Structural Equation Modelling // An easily
		accessible continuous (and discrete) time dynamic modelling
		package for panel and time series data, reliant upon the
		OpenMx. package (http://openmx.psyc.virginia.edu/) for
		computation. Most dynamic modelling approaches to longitudinal
		data rely on the assumption that time intervals between
		observations are consistent. When this assumption is adhered
		to, the data gathering process is necessarily limited to a
		specific schedule, and when broken, the resulting parameter
		estimates may be biased and reduced in power. Continuous time
		models are conceptually similar to vector autoregressive models
		(thus also the latent change models popularised in a structural
		equation modelling context), however by explicitly including
		the length of time between observations, continuous time models
		are freed from the assumption that measurement intervals are
		consistent. This allows: data to be gathered irregularly; the
		elimination of noise and bias due to varying measurement
		intervals; parsimonious structures for complex dynamics. The
		application of such a model in this SEM framework allows full-
		information maximum-likelihood estimates for both N = 1 and N
		1 cases, multiple measured indicators per latent process, and
		the flexibility to incorporate additional elements, including
		individual heterogeneity in the latent process and manifest
		intercepts, and time dependent and independent exogenous
		covariates. Furthermore, due to the SEM implementation we are
		able to estimate a random effects model where the impact of
		time dependent and time independent predictors can be assessed
		simultaneously, but without the classic problems of random
		effects models assuming no covariance between unit level
		effects and predictors.
