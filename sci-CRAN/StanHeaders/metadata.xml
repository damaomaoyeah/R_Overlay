		C++ Header Files for Stan // The C++ header files of the Stan
		project are provided by this package, but it contains no R
		code, shared objects, vignettes, or function documentation. It
		is only useful for developers who want to utilize the LinkingTo
		directive of their package's DESCRIPTION file to build on the
		Stan library without incurring unnecessary dependencies. The
		Stan project develops a probabilistic programming language that
		implements full Bayesian statistical inference via Markov Chain
		Monte Carlo and (optionally penalized) maximum likelihood
		estimation via optimization. The Stan library includes an
		advanced automatic differentiation scheme, templated
		statistical and linear algebra functions that can handle the
		automatically differentiable scalar types (and doubles, ints,
		etc.), and a parser for the Stan language. The 'rstan' package
		provides user-facing R functions to parse, compile, test,
		estimate, and analyze Stan models.
