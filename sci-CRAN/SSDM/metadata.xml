		Stacked Species Distribution Modelling // Allows to map species
		richness and endemism based on stacked species distribution
		models (SSDM). Individuals SDMs can be created using a single
		or multiple algorithms (ensemble SDMs). For each species, an
		SDM can yield a habitat suitability map, a binary map, a
		between-algorithm variance map, and can assess variable
		importance, algorithm accuracy, and between- algorithm
		correlation. Methods to stack individual SDMs include summing
		individual probabilities and thresholding then summing.
		Thresholding can be based on a specific evaluation metric or by
		drawing repeatedly from a Bernoulli distribution. The SSDM
		package also provides a user-friendly interface.
