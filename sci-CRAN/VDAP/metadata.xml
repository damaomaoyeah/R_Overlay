		Peptide Array Analysis Tools // Analyze Peptide Array Data and
		characterize peptide sequence space. Allows for high level
		visualization of global signal, Quality control based on
		replicate correlation and/or relative Kd, calculation of
		peptide Length/Charge/Kd parameters, Hits selection based on
		RFU Signal, and amino acid composition/basic motif recognition
		with RFU signal weighting. Basic signal trends can be used to
		generate peptides that follow the observed compositional
		trends.
