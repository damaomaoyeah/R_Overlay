		Improved Techniques to Estimate Trend, Velocity and Acceleration
		from Sea Level Records // Analysis of annual average ocean
		water level time series from long (minimum length 80 years)
		individual records, providing improved estimates of trend (mean
		sea level) and associated real-time velocities and
		accelerations. Improved trend estimates are based on Singular
		Spectrum Analysis methods. Various gap-filling options are
		included to accommodate incomplete time series records. The
		package also contains a forecasting module to consider the
		implication of user defined quantum of sea level rise between
		the end of the available historical record and the year 2100. A
		wide range of screen and pdf plotting options are available in
		the package.
