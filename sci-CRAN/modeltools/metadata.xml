		Tools and Classes for Statistical Models // A collection of tools
		to deal with statistical models. The functionality is
		experimental and the user interface is likely to change in the
		future. The documentation is rather terse, but packages `coin'
		and `party' have some working examples. However, if you find
		the implemented ideas interesting we would be very interested
		in a discussion of this proposal. Contributions are more than
		welcome!
