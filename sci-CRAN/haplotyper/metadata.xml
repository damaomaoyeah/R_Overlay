		Tool for Clustering Genotypes in Haplotypes // Function to
		identify  haplotypes within QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci). One
		haplotype is a combination of SNP (Single Nucleotide
		Polymorphisms) within the QTL. This function groups together
		all individuals of a population with the same haplotype. Each
		group contains individual with the same allele in each SNP,
		whether or not missing data. Thus, haplotyper groups
		individuals, that to be imputed, have a non-zero probability of
		having the same alleles in the entire sequence of SNP's.
		Moreover, haplotyper calculates such probability from relative
		frequencies.
