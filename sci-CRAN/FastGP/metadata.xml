		Efficiently Using Gaussian Processes with Rcpp and RcppEigen //
		Contains Rcpp and RcppEigen implementations of matrix
		operations useful for Gaussian process models, such as the
		inversion of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix, sampling from
		multivariate normal distributions, evaluation of the log-
		density of a multivariate normal vector, and Bayesian inference
		for latent variable Gaussian process models with elliptical
		slice sampling (Murray, Adams, and MacKay 2010).
