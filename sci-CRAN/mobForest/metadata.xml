		Model based Random Forest analysis // This package implements
		random forest method for model based recursive partitioning.
		The mob() function, developed by Zeileis et al (2008), within
		party package, is modified to construct model-based decision
		trees based on random forests methodology. The main input
		function mobForestAnalysis() takes all input parameters to
		construct trees, compute out-of-bag errors, predictions, and
		overall accuracy of forest. The algorithm performs parallel
		computation using clusterApply() function within 'parallel'
		package.
