		Sensitivity Indexes from Polynomial Chaos Expansions and PLS //
		Computation of sensitivity indexes by using a method based on a
		truncated Polynomial Chaos Expansion of the response and
		regression PLS, for computer models with correlated continuous
		inputs, whatever the input distribution. The truncated
		Polynomial Chaos Expansion is built from the multivariate
		Legendre orthogonal polynomials. The number of runs (rows) can
		be smaller than the number of monomials. It is possible to
		select only the most significant monomials. Of course, this
		package can also be used if the inputs are independent. Note
		that, when they are  independent and uniformly distributed, the
		package 'polychaosbasics' is more appropriate.
