		R at the Command-Line via 'r' // A scripting and command-line
		front-end is provided by 'r' (aka 'littler') as a lightweight
		binary wrapper around the GNU R language and environment for
		statistical computing and graphics. While R can be used in
		batch mode, the r binary adds full support for both
		'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hash-mark-exclamation-
		path expression as the first line in scripts) as well as
		command-line use in standard Unix pipelines. In other words, r
		provides the R language without the environment.
