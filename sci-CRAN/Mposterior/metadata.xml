		Mposterior: R package for Robust and Scalable Bayes via a Median
		of Subset Posterior Measures // Mposterior package provides a
		general framework for estimating a median of subset posterior
		measures (M-posterior). Each subset posterior measure is
		represented as a matrix of posterior samples; rows represent
		the atoms and columns index the dimensions. All subset measures
		are represented as list of matrices; length of the list equals
		the number of subsets (or machines). The distance between
		subset posterior measures and M-posterior is measured using the
		RBF kernel. M-posterior is represented as a weighted
		combination of empirical measures based on subsets measures.
		These weights are estimated using Weiszfeld algorithm
		implemented in this package.
