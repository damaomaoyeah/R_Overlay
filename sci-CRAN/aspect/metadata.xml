		A General Framework for Multivariate Analysis with Optimal
		Scaling // Contains various functions for optimal scaling. One
		function performs optimal scaling by maximizing an aspect (i.e.
		a target function such as the sum of eigenvalues, sum of
		squared correlations, squared multiple correlations, etc.) of
		the corresponding correlation matrix. Another function performs
		implements the LINEALS approach for optimal scaling by
		minimization of an aspect based on pairwise correlations and
		correlation ratios. The resulting correlation matrix and
		category scores can be used for further multivariate methods
		such as structural equation models.
