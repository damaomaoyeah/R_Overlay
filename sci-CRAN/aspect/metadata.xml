		Aspects of Multivariables // This package consists of two main
		functions: The first function is corAspect() performs optimal
		scaling by maximizing an aspect (i.e. a target function such as
		the sum of eigenvalues, sum of squared correlations, squared
		multiple correlations, etc.) of the corresponding correlation
		matrix. The second function is lineals() performs optimal
		scaling by minimization a non-correlational aspect based on
		pairwise correlations and correlation ratios. The resulting
		correlation matrix and category scores can be used for further
		multivariate methods such as SEM. A platform including related
		PsychoR packages is provided on R-Forge.
