		Installing, Managing, and Switching Between Distinct Sets of
		Installed Packages // Provides an abstraction for managing,
		installing, and switching between sets of installed R packages.
		This allows users to maintain multiple package libraries
		simultaneously, e.g. to maintain strict, package-version-
		specific reproducibility of many analyses, or work within a
		devel/release paradigm. Introduces a generalized package
		installation process which supports multiple repository and
		non-repository sources and tracks package provenance.
