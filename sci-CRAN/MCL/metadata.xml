		Markov Cluster Algorithm // Contains the Markov cluster algorithm
		(MCL) for identifying clusters in networks and graphs. The
		algorithm simulates random walks on a (n x n) matrix as the
		adjacency matrix of a graph. It alternates an expansion step
		and an inflation step until an equilibrium state is reached.
