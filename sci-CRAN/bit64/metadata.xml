		A S3 Class for Vectors of 64bit Integers // Package 'bit64'
		provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers that
		can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames.
		Methods are available for coercion from and to logicals,
		integers, doubles, characters and factors as well as many
		elementwise and summary functions. Many fast algorithmic
		operations such as 'match' and 'order' support interactive data
		exploration and manipulation and optionally leverage caching.
