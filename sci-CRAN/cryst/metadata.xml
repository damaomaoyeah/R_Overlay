		Calculate the Relative Crystallinity of Starch by XRD and FTIR //
		Functions to calculate the relative crystallinity of starch by
		X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).
		Starch is biosynthesized by plants in the form of granules
		semicrystalline. For XRD, the relative crystallinity is
		obtained by separating the crystalline peaks from the amorphous
		scattering region. For FTIR, the relative crystallinity is
		achieved by setting of a Gaussian holocrystalline-peak in the
		800-1300 cm-1 region of FTIR spectrum of starch which is
		divided into amorphous region and crystalline region. The
		relative crystallinity of native starch granules varies from 14
		of 45 percent. This package was supported by FONDECYT 3150630
