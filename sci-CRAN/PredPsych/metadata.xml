		Predictive Approaches in Psychology // Recent years have seen an
		increased interest in novel methods for analyzing quantitative
		data from experimental psychology. Currently, however, they
		lack an established and accessible software framework. Many
		existing implementations provide no guidelines, consisting of
		small code snippets, or sets of packages. In addition, the use
		of existing packages often requires advanced programming
		experience. 'PredPsych' is a user-friendly toolbox based on
		machine learning predictive algorithms. It comprises of
		multiple functionalities for multivariate analyses of
		quantitative behavioral data based on machine learning models.
