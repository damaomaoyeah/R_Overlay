		Publish Package Manifests to GitHub Gists // Provides a simple
		plugin to the switchr framework which allows users to publish
		manifests of packages - or of specific versions thereof - as
		single-file GitHub repositories (Gists). These manifest files
		can then be used as remote seeds (see switchr documentation)
		when creating new package libraries.
