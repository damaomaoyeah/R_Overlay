		Multivariate Dependence with FDG Copulas // FDG copulas are a
		class of copulas featuring an interesting balance between
		flexibility and tractability. This package provides tools to
		construct, calculate the pairwise dependence coefficients of,
		simulate from, and fit FDG copulas. The acronym FDG stands for
		'one-Factor with Durante Generators', as an FDG copula is a
		one-factor copula -- that is, the variables are independent
		given a latent factor -- whose linking copulas belong to the
		Durante class of bivariate copulas (also referred to as
		exchangeable Marshall-Olkin or semilinear copulas).
