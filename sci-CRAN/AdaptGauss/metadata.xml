		Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) // Multimodal distributions can be
		modelled as a mixture of components. The model is derived using
		the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) for an estimation of the
		pdf. PDE has been designed in particular to identify
		groups/classes in a dataset. Precise limits for the classes can
		be calculated using the theorem of Bayes. Verification of the
		model is possible by QQ plot and Chi-squared test.
