		Bayesian Semi and Nonparametric Growth Curve Models that
		Additionally Include Multiple Membership Random Effects //
		Employs a non-parametric formulation for by-subject random
		effect parameters to borrow strength over a constrained number
		of repeated measurement waves in a fashion that permits
		multiple effects per subject. One class of models employs a
		Dirichlet process (DP) prior for the subject random effects and
		includes an additional set of random effects that utilize a
		different grouping factor and are mapped back to clients
		through a multiple membership weight matrix; e.g. treatment(s)
		exposure or dosage. A second class of models employs a
		dependent DP (DDP) prior for the subject random effects that
		directly incorporates the multiple membership pattern.
