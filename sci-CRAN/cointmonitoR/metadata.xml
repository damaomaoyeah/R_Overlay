		Consistent Monitoring of Stationarity and Cointegrating
		Relationships // We propose a consistent monitoring procedure
		to detect a structural change from a cointegrating relationship
		to a spurious relationship. The procedure is based on residuals
		from modified least squares estimation, using either Fully
		Modified, Dynamic or Integrated Modified OLS. It is inspired by
		Chu et al. (1996) DOI:10.2307/2171955 in that it is based on
		parameter estimation on a pre-break "calibration" period only,
		rather than being based on sequential estimation over the full
		sample. See the discussion paper DOI:10.2139/ssrn.2624657 for
		further information. This package provides the monitoring
		procedures for both the cointegration and the stationarity case
		(while the latter is just a special case of the former one) as
		well as printing and plotting methods for a clear presentation
		of the results.
