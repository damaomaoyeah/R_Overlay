		Package for analysis of spatial data // This package provides
		tools to assess the association between two spatial processes.
		Currently, three methodologies are implemented: An adapted
		t-test to perform hypothesis testing about the independence
		between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation
		coefficient, and the codispersion coefficient. SpatialPack
		gives methods to complement methodologies that are available in
		geoR for one spatial process.
