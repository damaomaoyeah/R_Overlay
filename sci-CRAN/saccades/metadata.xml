		Detection of Fixations in Eye-Tracking Data // Functions for
		detecting eye fixations in raw eye-tracking data.  The
		detection is done using a velocity-based algorithm for saccade
		detection proposed by Ralf Engbert and Reinhold Kliegl in 2003.
		The algorithm labels segments as saccades when the velocity of
		the eye movement exceeds a certain threshold.  Anything between
		two saccades is considered a fixation.  Thus the algorithm is
		not appropriate for data containing episodes of smooth pursuit
		eye movements.
