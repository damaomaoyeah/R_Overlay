		Read-Write Support for NumPy Files via Rcpp // The cnpy library
		written by Carl Rogers provides read and write facilities for
		files created with (or for) the NumPy extension for Python.
		Vectors and matrices of numeric types can be read or written to
		and from files as well as compressed files. Support for integer
		files is available if the package has been built with
		-std=c++11 which is the default starting with release 0.2.3
		following the release of R 3.1.0.
