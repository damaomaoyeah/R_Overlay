		Functions to Compute Chemical Reaction Similarity // RxnSim
		provides methods to compute chemical similarity between two or
		more reactions and molecules. Molecular similarity is computed
		based on structural features. Reaction similarity is a function
		of similarities of participating molecules. The package
		additionally provides functionality to mask chemical
		substructures for weighted similarity computations. It uses
		rCDK and fingerprint packages for cheminformatics
		functionality.
