		Brier score decomposition of probabilistic forecasts for binary
		events // Decomposes the empirical Brier score into
		reliability, resolution and uncertainty. Two different
		estimators for the components are provided: The original
		estimators proposed by Murphy (1974), and the bias-corrected
		estimators proposed by Ferro and Fricker (2012). Sampling
		variances of all the components are estimated. This package
		applies only to probabilistic predictions of binary events.
