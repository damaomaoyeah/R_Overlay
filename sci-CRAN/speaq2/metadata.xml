		Wavelet Based Tools for Feature-Wise Analysis and Quantification
		of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectra // Tools for
		feature based analysis of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
		spectra. Wavelets are used to quantify the peaks which are
		grouped into features with hierarchical clustering. The results
		can easily be incorporated in large-scale studies that include
		LC-MS analysis (as this is also peak/feature based).
