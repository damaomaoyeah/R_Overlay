		Estimating Genome-Wide Significance for Whole Genome Sequencing
		Studies, Either Single SNP Tests or Region-Based Tests // The
		correlations and linkage disequilibrium between tests can vary
		as a function of minor allele frequency thresholds used to
		filter variants, and also varies with different choices of test
		statistic for region-based tests. Appropriate genome-wide
		significance thresholds can be estimated empirically through
		permutation on only a small proportion of the whole genome.
