		Statistical Toolbox for Radiometric Geochronology // An R
		implementation of Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to
		Microsoft Excel. Currently plots U-Pb data on Wetherill and
		Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagrams. Calculates concordia and
		discordia ages. Performs linear regression of measurements with
		correlated errors using the 'York' approach. Generates Kernel
		Density Estimates (KDEs) and Cumulative Age Distributions
		(CADs). Produces Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) configurations
		and Shepard plots of multi-sample detrital datasets using the
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance as a dissimilarity measure.
		Calculates 40A/39Ar ages, isochrons, and age spectra. Computes
		weighted means accounting for overdispersion. Calculates U-Th-
		He (single grain and central) ages, logratio plots and ternary
		diagrams. Future versions will include functionality for the
		Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Re-Os, fission track and cosmogenic nuclide
		methods, radial plots and banana diagrams. A graphical user
		interface is provided as an RStudio Shiny app at
		http://isoplotr.london-geochron.com. Offline access to this
		interface will be provided at a later point in time.
