		Statistical Toolbox for Radiometric Geochronology // An R
		implementation of Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to
		Microsoft Excel. Currently plots U-Pb data on Wetherill and
		Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagrams. Calculates concordia and
		discordia ages. Performs linear regression of measurements with
		correlated errors using the 'York' approach. Generates Kernel
		Density Estimates (KDEs) and Cumulative Age Distributions
		(CADs). Future versions will include functionality for the Ar-
		Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Re-Os, U-Th-He, fission track and cosmogenic
		nuclide methods, including isochrons, age spectra, ternary
		diagrams, radial plots, banana diagrams and multidimensional
		scaling plots. A graphical user interface is provided as an
		RStudio Shiny app at http://isoplotr.london-geochron.com.
		Offline access to this interface will be provided at a later
		point in time.
