		Statistical Toolbox for Radiometric Geochronology // An R
		implementation of Ken Ludwig's popular Isoplot add-in to
		Microsoft Excel. Currently plots U-Pb data on Wetherill and
		Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagrams. Calculates concordia and
		discordia ages. Performs linear regression of measurements with
		correlated errors using the 'York' approach. Future versions
		will include functionality for the Ar-Ar, Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, Re-Os,
		U-Th-He, fission track and cosmogenic nuclide methods,
		including isochrons, age spectra, ternary diagrams, kernel
		density estimates, radial plots, banana diagrams and
		multidimensional scaling plots. A graphical user interface is
		provided as an RStudio Shiny app.
