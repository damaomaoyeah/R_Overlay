		Ordinal Dominance Statistics // Computes ordinal, statistics and
		effect sizes as an alternative to mean comparison: Cliff's
		delta or success rate difference (SRD), Vargha and Delaney's A
		or the Area Under a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
		(AUC), the discrete type of McGraw  Wong's Common Language
		Effect Size (CLES) or Grissom  Kim's Probability of Superiority
		(PS), and the Number needed to treat (NNT) effect size.
		Moreover, comparisons to Cohen's d are offered based on Huberty
		Lowman's Percentage of Group (Non-)Overlap considerations.
