		Estimating Replication Rate for Genome-Wide Association Studies
		// Replication Rate (RR) is the probability of replicating a
		statistically significant association in genome-wide
		association studies. This R-package provide the estimation
		method for replication rate which makes use of the summary
		statistics from the primary study. We can use the estimated RR
		to determine the sample size of the replication study, and to
		check the consistency between the results of the primary study
		and those of the replication study.
