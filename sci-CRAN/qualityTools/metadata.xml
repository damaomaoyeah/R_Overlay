		Statistical Methods for Quality Science // This Package contains
		methods associated with the Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve
		and Control (i.e. DMAIC) cycle of the Six Sigma Quality
		Management methodology.It covers distribution fitting, normal
		and non-normal process capability indices, techniques for
		Measurement Systems Analysis especially gage capability indices
		and Gage Repeatability (i.e Gage RR) and Reproducibility
		studies, factorial and fractional factorial designs as well as
		response surface methods including the use of desirability
		functions. Improvement via Six Sigma is project based strategy
		that covers 5 phases: Define - Pareto Chart; Measure -
		Probability and Quantile-Quantile Plots, Process Capability
		Indices for various distributions and Gage RR Analyze i.e.
		Pareto Chart, Multi-Vari Chart, Dot Plot; Improve - Full and
		fractional factorial, response surface and mixture designs as
		well as the desirability approach for simultaneous optimization
		of more than one response variable. Normal, Pareto and Lenth
		Plot of effects as well as Interaction Plots; Control - Quality
		Control Charts can be found in the qcc package. The focus is on
		teaching the statistical methodology used in the Quality
		Sciences.
