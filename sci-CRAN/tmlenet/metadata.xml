		Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Network Data //
		Estimation of average causal effects for single time point
		interventions in network-dependent data (e.g., in the presence
		of spillover and/or interference). Supports arbitrary
		interventions (static or stochastic). Implemented estimation
		algorithms are the targeted maximum likelihood estimation
		(TMLE), the inverse-probability-of-treatment (IPTW) estimator
		and the parametric G-computation formula estimator.
		Asymptotically correct influence-curve-based confidence
		intervals are constructed for the TMLE and IPTW. The data are
		assumed to consist of rows of unit-specific observations, each
		row i represented by variables (F.i,W.i,A.i,Y.i), where F.i is
		a vector of friend IDs of unit i (i's network), W.i is a vector
		of i's baseline covariates, A.i is i's exposure (can be binary,
		categorical or continuous) and Y.i is i's binary outcome.
		Exposure A.i depends on (multivariate) user-specified baseline
		summary measure(s) sW.i, where sW.i is any function of i's
		baseline covariates W.i and the baseline covariates of i's
		friends in F.i. Outcome Y.i depends on sW.i and (multivariate)
		user-specified summary measure(s) sA.i, where sA.i is any
		function of i's baseline covariates and exposure (W.i,A.i) and
		the baseline covariates and exposures of i's friends. The
		summary measures are defined with functions def.sW and def.sA.
