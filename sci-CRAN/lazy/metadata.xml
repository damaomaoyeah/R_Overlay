		Lazy Learning for Local Regression // By combining constant,
		linear, and quadratic local models, lazy estimates the value of
		an unknown multivariate function on the basis of a set of
		possibly noisy samples of the function itself.  This
		implementation of lazy learning automatically adjusts the
		bandwidth on a query-by-query basis through a leave-one-out
		cross-validation.
