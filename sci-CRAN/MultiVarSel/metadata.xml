		Variable Selection in the Multivariate Linear Model // It
		provides a novel variable selection approach in the
		multivariate framework of the general linear model taking into
		account the dependence that may exist between the columns of
		the observations matrix. For further details we refer the
		reader to the paper Perrot-Dockes et al. (2017),
		arXiv:1704.00076.
