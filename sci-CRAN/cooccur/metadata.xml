		Probabilistic Species Co-occurrence Analysis in R // This R
		package applies the probabilistic model of species co-
		occurrence (Veech 2013) to a set of species distributed among a
		set of survey or sampling sites. The algorithm calculates the
		observed and expected frequencies of co-occurrence between each
		pair of species. The expected frequency is based on the
		distribution of each species being random and independent of
		the other species. The analysis returns the probabilities that
		a more extreme (either low or high) value of co-occurrence
		could have been obtained by chance. The package also includes
		functions for visualizing species co-occurrence results and
		preparing data for downstream analyses.
