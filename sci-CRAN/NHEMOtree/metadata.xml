		Non-hierarchical evolutionary multi-objective tree learner to
		perform cost-sensitive classification // NHEMOtree performs
		cost-sensitive classification by solving the two-objective
		optimization problem of minimizing misclassification rate and
		minimizing total costs for classification. The three methods
		comprised in NHEMOtree are based on EMOAs with either tree
		representation or bitstring representation with an enclosed
		classification tree algorithm.
