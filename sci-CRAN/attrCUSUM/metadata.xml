		Tools for Attribute VSI CUSUM Control Chart // An implementation
		of tools for design of attribute variable sampling interval
		cumulative sum chart. It currently provides information for
		monitoring of mean increase such as average number of sample to
		signal, average time to signal, a matrix of transient
		probabilities, suitable control limits when the data are (zero
		inflated) Poisson/binomial distribution. Functions in the tools
		can be easily applied to other count processes. Also, tools
		might be extended to more complicated cumulative sum control
		chart. We leave these issues as our perpetual work.
