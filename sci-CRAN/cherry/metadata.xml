		Multiple testing methods for exploratory research // This package
		implements a class of multiple testing methods that does not
		prescribe the user what hypotheses to reject, but instead
		allows the user to select the set of selected hypotheses
		freely. The multiple testing procedure aids this selection by
		providing an upper confidence bound for the number of false
		rejections among the selected set. Because the confidence
		bounds are simultaneous for all possible rejected sets, the
		validity is not compromised by post hoc selection. Some of the
		functions in this package are optionally enhanced by the gurobi
		software and its accompanying R package. For installation of
		gurobi, follow the instructions at
		http://pages.gurobi.com/DownloadRegistration.html?/download
		/gurobi-optimizer and http://www.gurobi.com/documentation/5.6
		/quick-start-guide/r_installing_the_r_package.
