		Stylized concatenation of data.frames or ffdfs // Stacks
		rectangular datasets on top of each other, possibly performing
		several type coercions along the way. For large datasets,
		depends on the ff package. Provides an aggressive version of
		ffbase::compact for data that may appear be real-typed but is
		in fact int/short/byte. For many purposes plyr::rbind.fill may
		be more appropriate, but for some kinds of survey data, the
		rules here work better.
