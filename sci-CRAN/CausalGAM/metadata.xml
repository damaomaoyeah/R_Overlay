		Estimation of Causal Effects with Generalized Additive Models //
		This package implements various estimators for average
		treatment effects---an inverse probability weighted (IPW)
		estimator, an augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW)
		estimator, and a standard regression estimator---that make use
		of generalized additive models for the treatment assignment
		model and/or outcome model.
