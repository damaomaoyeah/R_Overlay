		A Latent Variable Model for Mixed Continuous and Ordinal
		Responses // A model for mixed ordinal and continuous responses
		is presented where the heteroscedasticity of the variance of
		the continuous response is also modeled. In this model ordinal
		response can be dependent on the continuous response. The aim
		is to use an approach similar to that of Heckman (1978) for the
		joint modelling of the ordinal and continuous responses. With
		this model, the dependence between responses can be taken into
		account by the correlation between errors in the models for
		continuous and ordinal responses
