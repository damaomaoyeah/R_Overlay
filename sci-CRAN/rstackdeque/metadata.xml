		Persistent Fast Amortized Stack and Queue Data Structures //
		Provides fast, persistent (side-effect-free) stack, queue and
		deque (double-ended-queue) data structures. While deques
		include a superset of functionality provided by queues, in
		these implementations queues are more efficient in some
		specialized situations. See the documentation for rstack,
		rdeque, and rpqueue for details.
