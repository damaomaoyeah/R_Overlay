		Phytoplankton Production Tools // Fits PE and RLC data to one of
		a four published PE models. Simulates incident irradiance as a
		function of time and space. Calculates phytoplankton production
		by transposing modeled PE or RLC data to a water column with a
		user-defined theoretical in-situ irradiance field.
