		R package for somoclu // Somoclu is a cluster-oriented
		implementation of self-organizing maps. It
		relies on MPI for distributing the workload, and it can be
		accelerated by                       CUDA on a GPU cluster. A
		sparse kernel is also included, which is useful for
		training maps on vector spaces generated in text mining
		processes.
