		methods of distance-based gene set functional enrichment
		analysis. // This package provides methods and examples to
		support a method of Gene Set Analysis (GSA).  DBGSA is a novel
		distance-based gene set enrichment analysis method. We consider
		that, the distance between 2 groups with different phenotype by
		focusing on the gene expression should be larger, if a certain
		gene functional set was significantly associated with a
		particular phenotype.
