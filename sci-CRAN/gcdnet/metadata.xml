		LASSO and (adaptive) Elastic-Net penalized least squares,
		logistic regression, HHSVM and squared hinge loss SVM using a
		fast GCD algorithm // This package implements a generalized
		coordinate descent (GCD) algorithm for computing the solution
		path of the hybrid Huberized support vector machine (HHSVM) and
		its generalization, including the elastic net penalized least
		squares, the elastic net penalized SVM with the squared hinge
		loss and the elastic net penalized logistic regression.
