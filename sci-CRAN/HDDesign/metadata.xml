		Sample Size Calculation for High Dimensional Classification Study
		// Determine the sample size requirement to achieve the target
		probability of correct classification (PCC) for studies
		employing high-dimensional features.  The package implements
		functions to 1) determine the asymptotic feasibility of the
		classification problem; 2) compute the upper bounds of the PCC
		for any linear classifier; 3) estimate the PCC of three design
		methods given design assumptions; 4) determine the sample size
		requirement to achieve the target PCC for three design methods.
