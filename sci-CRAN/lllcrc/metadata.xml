		Local Log-linear Models for Capture-Recapture // Applies local
		log-linear capture-recapture models (LLLMs) for closed
		populations, as described in the doctoral thesis of Zachary
		Kurtz. The method is relevant when there are 3-5 capture
		occasions, with auxiliary covariates available for all capture
		occasions.  As part of estimating the number of missing
		population units, the method estimates the "rate of
		missingness" as it varies over the covariate space.  In
		addition, user-friendly functions are provided to recreate
		(approximately) the method of Zwane and van der Heijden (2004),
		which applied the VGAM package in a way that is closely related
		to LLLMs.
