		Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) using CUDA // Wrapper
		package for the nmfgpu library, which implements several Non-
		negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms for CUDA
		platforms. By using the acceleration of GPGPU computing, the
		NMF can be used for real-world problems inside the R
		environment. All CUDA devices starting with Kepler architecture
		are supported by the library.
