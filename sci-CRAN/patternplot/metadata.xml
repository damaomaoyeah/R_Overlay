		Versatile Pie Chart using Patterns, Colors, and Images // Creates
		aesthetically pleasing and informative pie charts. It can plot
		pie charts either in black and white or in colors, with or
		without filled patterns. On the one hand, black and white pie
		charts filled with patterns are useful for publications,
		especially when an increasing number of journals only accept
		black and white figures or charge a significant amount for a
		color figure. On the other hand, colorful pie charts with or
		without patterns are useful for print design, online
		publishing, or poster and 'PowerPoint' presentations.
		'patternplot' allows the flexibility of a variety of
		combinations of patterns and colors to choose from. It also has
		the ability to fill in the slices with any external images in
		'png' and 'jpeg' formats. In summary, 'patternplot' allows the
		users to be as creative as they can while creating pie charts!
