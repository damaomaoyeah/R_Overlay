		HapIM // The package provides a set of functions whose aim is to
		propose 4 methods of QTL detection. HAPimLD is an interval-
		mapping method designed for unrelated individuals with no
		family information that makes use of linkage disequilibrium.
		HAPimLDL is an interval-mapping method for design of half-sib
		families. It combines linkage analysis and linkage
		disequilibrium. HaploMax is based on an analysis of variance
		with a dose haplotype effect. HaploMaxHS is based on an
		analysis of variance with a sire effect and a dose haplotype
		effect in half-sib family design.  Fundings for the package
		development were provided to the LDLmapQTL project by the ANR
		GENANIMAL program and APIS-GENE.
