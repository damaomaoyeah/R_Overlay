		Pomic // This package propose calculations of an information
		criterion to check the quality of simulations results of
		ABM/IBM or other non-linear rule-based models. The POMDEV
		measure is based on the KL divergence and likelihood theory. It
		basically indicates the deviance of simulation results from
		field observations. Once POMDEV scores and metropolis-hasting
		sampling on different model versions are effectuated, POMIC
		scores can be calculated. This method is still under
		development and further work are needed for the incorporation
		of multiple patterns assessment.
