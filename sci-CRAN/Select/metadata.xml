		Estimates Species Abundances Based on Functional Traits // For
		estimating species abundances that satisfy a given functional
		trait profile. Restoring resilient ecosystems requires a
		flexible framework for selecting assemblages that are based on
		the functional traits of species. However, current trait-based
		models have been biased toward algorithms that can only select
		species by optimising specific trait values, and could not
		elegantly accommodate the common desire among restoration
		ecologists to produce functionally diverse assemblages. We have
		solved this problem by applying a non-linear optimisation
		algorithm that optimises Raos Q, a closed-form functional
		diversity index that incorporates species abundances, subject
		to other linear constraints. This framework generalises
		previous models that could only optimise the entropy of the
		community, and can optimise both functional diversity and
		entropy simultaneously.
