		Multivariate Weather-State Approach Conditionally Skew-Normal
		Generator // Multivariate weather generator for daily climate
		variables based on weather-states using a Markov chain for
		modeling the succession of weather states. Conditionally to the
		weather states, the multivariate variables are modeled using
		the family of Complete Skew-Normal distributions. Parameters
		are estimated on measured series. Data must include the
		variable 'Rain' and can accept as many other variables as
		desired.
