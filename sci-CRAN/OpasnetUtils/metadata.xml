		Opasnet Modelling Environment Utility Functions // Contains tools
		for open assessment and modelling in Opasnet, a wiki-based web
		site and workspace for societal decision making (see
		http://en.opasnet.org/w/Main_Page for more information). The
		core principle of the workspace is maximal openness and
		modularity. Variables are defined on public wiki pages using
		wiki inputs/tables, databases and R code. This package provides
		the functionality to download and use these variables. It also
		contains health impact assessment tools such as spatial methods
		for exposure modelling.
