		Bagged k-Nearest Neighbors Survival Prediction // Implements a
		bootstrap aggregated (bagged) version of the k-nearest
		neighbors survival probability prediction method (Lowsky et al.
		2013). In addition to the bootstrapping of training samples,
		the features can be subsampled in each baselearner to break the
		correlation between them. The Rcpp package is used to speed up
		the computation.
