		Creates Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Boosting Models,
		and applies them to GIS .img files to build detailed prediction
		maps. // This package will create sophisticated models of
		training data and validate the models with an independent test
		set, cross validation, or in the case of Random Forest Models,
		with Out Of Bag (OOB) predictions on the training data. It will
		create graphs and tables of the model validation results. It
		will apply these models to GIS .img files of predictors to
		create detailed prediction surfaces. It will handle large
		predictor files for map making, by reading in the .img files in
		chunks, and output to the .txt file the prediction for each
		data chunk, before reading the next chunk of data.
