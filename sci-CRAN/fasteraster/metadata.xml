		Raster Image Processing and Vector Recognition // If there is a
		need to recognise edges on a raster image or a bitmap or any
		kind of a matrix, one can find packages that does only 90
		degrees vectorization. Typically the nature of artefact images
		is linear and can be vectorized in much more efficient way than
		draw a series of 90 degrees lines. The fasteraster package does
		recognition of lines using only one pass.
