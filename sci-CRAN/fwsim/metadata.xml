		Fisher-Wright Population Simulation // Simulates a population
		under the Fisher-Wright model (fixed or stochastic population
		size) with a one-step neutral mutation process (stepwise
		mutation model, logistic mutation model and exponential
		mutation model supported). The stochastic population sizes are
		random Poisson distributed and different kinds of population
		growth are supported. For the stepwise mutation model, it is
		possible to specify locus and direction specific mutation rate
		(in terms of upwards and downwards mutation rate). Intermediate
		generations can be saved in order to study e.g. drift.
