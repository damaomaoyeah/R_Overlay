		Generated Effect Modifier // An implementation of the generated
		effect modifier (GEM) method. This method constructs composite
		variables by linearly combining pre-treatment scalar patient
		characteristics to create optimal treatment effect modifiers in
		linear models. The optimal linear combination is called a GEM.
		Treatment is assumed to have been assigned at random. For
		reference, see E Petkova, T Tarpey, Z Su, and RT Ogden.
