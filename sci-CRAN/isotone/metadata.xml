		Active Set and Generalized PAVA for Isotone Optimization //
		Contains two main functions: one for solving general isotone
		regression problems using the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm
		(PAVA); another one provides a framework for active set methods
		for isotone optimization problems with arbitrary order
		restrictions. Various types of loss functions are prespecified.
