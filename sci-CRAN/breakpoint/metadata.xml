		Multiple Break-Point Detection via the Cross-Entropy Method //
		Implements the cross-entropy (CE) method, which is a model
		based stochastic optimization technique to estimate both the
		number and their corresponding locations of break-points in
		biological sequences of continuous and discrete measurements as
		described in Priyadarshana and Sofronov (2014, 2012a, 2012b).
