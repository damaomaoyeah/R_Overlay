		Quantification of Lifecourse Fluidity // Provides in built
		datasets and three functions. These functions are
		mobility_index, nonStanTest and linkedLives.  The
		mobility_index function facilitates the calculation of
		lifecourse fluidity, whilst the nonStanTest and the linkedLives
		functions allow the user to determine the probability that the
		observed sequence data was due to chance.  The linkedLives
		function acknowledges the fact that some individuals may have
		identical sequences. The datasets available provide sequence
		data on marital status(maritalData) and mobility (mydata) for a
		selected group of individuals from the British Household Panel
		Study (BHPS).  In addition, personal and house ID's for 100
		individuals are provided in a third dataset (myHouseID) from
		the BHPS.
