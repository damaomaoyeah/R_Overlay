		Model-Based Estimation of Confounder-Adjusted Attributable
		Fractions // Estimates the attributable fraction in different
		sampling designs adjusted for measured confounders using
		logistic regression (cross-sectional and case-control designs),
		conditional logistic regression (matched case-control design)
		and Cox proportional hazard regression (cohort design with
		time-to-event outcome). The variance of the estimator is
		obtained by combining the delta method with the the sandwich
		formula.
