		Convenient Base R String Handling // Base R already ships with
		string handling capabilities 'out-of-the-box' but lacks
		streamlined function names and workflow. The 'stringi'
		('stringr') package on the other hand has well named functions,
		extensive Unicode support and allows for a streamlined
		workflow. On the other hand it adds dependencies and regular
		expression interpretation between base R functions and
		'stringi' functions might differ. This packages aims at
		providing a solution to the use case of unwanted dependencies
		on the one hand but the need for streamlined text processing on
		the other. The packages' functions are solely based on wrapping
		base R functions into 'stringr'/'stringi' like function names.
		Along the way it adds one or two extra functions and last but
		not least provides all functions as generics, therefore
		allowing for adding methods for other text structures besides
		plain character vectors.
