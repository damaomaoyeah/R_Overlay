		Interface to 'Lp_solve' v. 5.5 to Solve Linear/Integer Programs
		// Lp_solve is freely available (under LGPL 2) software for
		solving linear, integer and mixed integer programs. In this
		implementation we supply a "wrapper" function in C and some R
		functions that solve general linear/integer problems,
		assignment problems, and transportation problems. This version
		calls lp_solve version 5.5.
