		DEvelopment (of Multi-Linear QSPR/QSAR) MOdels VAlidated using
		Test Set // Tool for the development of multi-linear QSPR/QSAR
		models (Quantitative structure-property/activity relationship).
		Theses models are used in chemistry, biology and pharmacy to
		find a relationship between the structure of a molecule and its
		property (such as activity, toxicology but also physical
		properties). The various functions of this package allows:
		selection of descriptors based of variances, intercorrelation
		and user expertise; selection of the best multi-linear
		regression in terms of correlation and robustness; methods of
		internal validation (Leave-One-Out, Leave-Many-Out,
		Y-scrambling) and external using test sets.
