		Sampling Methods and Distribution Functions for the Ising Model
		// Sample states from the Ising model and compute the
		probability of states. Sampling can be done for any number of
		nodes, but due to the intractibility of the Ising model the
		distribution can only be computed up to ~10 nodes.
