		Alignment of Phonetic Sequence Using the 'ALINE' Algorithm //
		Functions are provided to calculate the 'ALINE' Distance
		between a cognate pair. The score is based on phonetic features
		represented using the Unicode-compliant International Phonetic
		Alphabet (IPA). Parameterized features weights used to
		determine the optimal alignment and functions are provided to
		estimate optimum values.This project was funded by the National
		Science Foundation Cultural Anthropology Program (Grant number
		SBS-1030031) and the University of Maryland College of
