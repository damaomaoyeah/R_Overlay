		Estimation of Entropy, Mutual Information and Related Quantities
		// This package implements various estimators of entropy, such
		as the shrinkage estimator by Hausser and Strimmer, the maximum
		likelihood and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian
		estimators, and the Chao-Shen estimator.  It also offers an R
		interface to the NSB estimator. Furthermore, it provides
		functions for estimating Kullback-Leibler divergence, chi-
		squared, mutual information, and chi-squared statistic of
		independence. In addition there are functions for discretizing
		continuous random variables.
