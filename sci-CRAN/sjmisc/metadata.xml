		Data Transformation and Labelled Data Utility Functions //
		Collection of miscellaneous utility functions (especially
		intended for people coming from other statistical software
		packages like 'SPSS', and/or who are new to R), supporting
		following common tasks: 1) Reading and writing data between R
		and other statistical software packages like 'SPSS', 'SAS' or
		'Stata' and working with labelled data; this includes easy ways
		to get and set label attributes, to convert labelled vectors
		into factors (and vice versa), or to deal with multiple
		declared missing values etc. 2) Data transformation tasks like
		recoding, dichotomizing or grouping variables, setting and
		replacing missing values. 3) Convenient functions to perform
		frequently used statistical tests, or to calculate various
		commonly used statistical coefficients.
