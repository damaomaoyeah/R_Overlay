		Trades, Curves, Rating Tables, Add-on Tables, CSAs // Contains
		trades from the five major assets classes and also
		functionality to use pricing curves, rating tables, CSAs and
		add-on tables. The implementation follows an object oriented
		logic whereby each trade inherits from more abstract classes
		while also the curves/tables are objects. There is a lot of
		functionality focusing on the counterparty credit risk
		calculations however the package can be used for trading
		applications in general.
