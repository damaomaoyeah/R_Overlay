		Determine Event Boundaries in Event Segmentation Experiments //
		Contains functions that help to determine event boundaries in
		event segmentation experiments by bootstrapping a critical
		segmentation magnitude under the null hypothesis that all key
		presses were randomly distributed across the experiment.
		Segmentation magnitude is defined as the sum of Gaussians
		centered at the times of the segmentation key presses performed
		by the participants. Within a participant, the maximum of the
		overlaid Gaussians is used to prevent an excessive influence of
		a single participant on the overall outcome (e.g. if a
		participant is pressing the key multiple times in succession).
		Further functions are included, such as plotting the results.
