		Group Screening and Selection // Contains the tools to screen
		grouped variables, and select screened grouped variables
		afterwards. The main function grpss() can perform the grouped
		variables screening as well as selection for ultra-high
		dimensional data with group structure. The screening step is
		primarily used to reduce the dimensions of data so that the
		selection procedure can easily handle the moderate or low
		dimensions instead of ultra-high dimensions.
