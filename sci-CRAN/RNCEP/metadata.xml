		Obtain, Organize, and Visualize NCEP Weather Data // This package
		contains functions to retrieve, organize, and visualize weather
		data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/ps
		d/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html) and NCEP/DOE
		Reanalysis II (http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.n
		cep.reanalysis2.html) datasets.  Data are queried via the
		Internet and may be obtained for a specified spatial and
		temporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time.
		We also provide functions to visualize these weather data on a
		map.  There are also functions to simulate flight trajectories
		according to specified behavior using either NCEP wind data or
		data specified by the user.
