		Generalization of the Convex Hull of a Sample of Points in the
		Plane // Computation of the alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull
		of a given sample of points in the plane. The concepts of
		alpha-shape and alpha-convex hull generalize the definition of
		the convex hull of a finite set of points. The programming is
		based on the duality between the Voronoi diagram and Delaunay
		triangulation. The package also includes a function that
		returns the Delaunay mesh of a given sample of points and its
		dual Voronoi diagram in one single object.
