		Phylogenetic Clustering (Phyloclustering) // Phylogenetic
		clustering (phyloclustering) is an evolutionary Continuous Time
		Markov Chain model-based approach to identify population
		structure from molecular data without assuming linkage
		equilibrium. The package phyclust (Chen 2011) provides a
		convenient implementation of phyloclustering for DNA and SNP
		data, capable of clustering individuals into subpopulations and
		identifying molecular sequences representative of those
		subpopulations. It is designed in C for performance, interfaced
		with R for visualization, and incorporates other popular open
		source programs including ms (Hudson 2002), seq-gen (Rambaut
		and Grassly 1997), Hap-Clustering (Tzeng 2005) and PAML baseml
		(Yang 1997, 2007), for simulating data, additional analyses,
		and searching the best tree. See the phyclust website for more
		information, documentations and examples.
