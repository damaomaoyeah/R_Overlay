		Computation of the Balance - Sample Size Frontier in Matching
		Methods for Causal Inference // Returns the subset of the data
		with the minimum imbalance for every possible subset size (N -
		1, N - 2, ...), down to the data set with the minimum possible
		imbalance. Also includes tools for the estimation of causal
		effects for each subset size, functions for visualization and
		data export, and functions for calculating model dependence as
		proposed by Athey and Imbens.
