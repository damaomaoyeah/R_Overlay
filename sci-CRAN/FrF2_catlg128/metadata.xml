		Catalogues of resolution IV 128 run 2-level fractional factorials
		up to 33 factors that do have 5-letter words // This package
		provides catalogues of resolution IV regular fractional
		factorial designs in 128 runs for up to 33 2-level factors. The
		catalogues are complete, excluding resolution IV designs
		without 5-letter words, because these do not add value for a
		search for clear designs. The previous package version 1.0 with
		complete catalogues up to 24 runs (24 runs and a namespace
		added later) can be downloaded from the authors website.
