		Concave 1-norm and 2-norm group penalty in linear and logistic
		regression // The package implements the concave 1-norm and
		2-norm group penalty in linear and logistic regression. The
		concave 1-norm group penalty includes 1-norm group SCAD and
		1-norm group MCP. The concave 1-norm group penalty has bi-level
		selection features. That is it selects variables at group and
		individual levels with proper tuning parameters. The concave
		1-norm group penalty is robust to mis-specified group
		information. The concave 2-norm group penalty includes 2-norm
		group SCAD and 2-norm group MCP. The concave 2-norm group
		penalty select variable at group level only. The package can
		also fit group Lasso, which is a special case of concave 2-norm
		group penalty when the regularization parameter kappa equals
		zero. The highly efficient (block) coordinate descent algorithm
		(CDA) is used to compute the solutions for both penalties in
		linear models. The highly stable and efficient (block) CDA and
		minimization-majorization approach are used to compute the
		solution for both penalties in logistic models. In the
		computation of solution surface, the solution path along kappa
		is implemented. This provides a better solution path compared
		to the solution path along lambda. The package also provides a
		tuning parameter selection method based on cross-validation for
		both linear and logistic models.
