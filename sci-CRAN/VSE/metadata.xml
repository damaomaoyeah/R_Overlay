		Variant Set Enrichment // Calculates the enrichment of associated
		variant set (AVS) for an array of genomic regions. The AVS is
		the collection of disjoint LD blocks computed from a list of
		disease associated SNPs and their linked (LD) SNPs. VSE
		generates a null distribution of matched random variant sets
		(MRVSs) from 1000 Genome Project Phase III data that are
		identical to AVS, LD block by block. It then computes the
		enrichment of AVS intersecting with user provided genomic
		features (e.g., histone marks or transcription factor binding
		sites) compared with the null distribution.
