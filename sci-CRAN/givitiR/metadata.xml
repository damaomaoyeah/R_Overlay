		The GiViTI Calibration Test and Belt // Functions to assess the
		calibration of logistic regression models with the GiViTI
		(Gruppo Italiano per la Valutazione degli interventi in Terapia
		Intensiva, Italian Group for the Evaluation of the
		Interventions in Intensive Care Units - see
		http://www.giviti.marionegri.it/) approach. The approach
		consists in a graphical tool, namely the GiViTI calibration
		belt, and in the associated statistical test. These tools can
		be used both to evaluate the internal calibration (i.e. the
		goodness of fit) and to assess the validity of an externally
		developed model.
