		Queries and Annotates SNPs, Genes and Pathway from NCBI // This
		annotates lists of SNPs and/or genes, with current information
		from NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information,
		U.S.A.). Functions are provided that with one command will
		provide annotation of the results from genome wide association
		studies to provide a broader context of their meaning. Other
		functions enable comparisons between a user's GWA results, and
		candidate snp/gene lists that are created from keywords, such
		as specific diseases, phenotypes or gene ontology terms.
		Commands are simple to follow and designed to work with R
		objects to integrate into existing workflows. The output
		produces text fields and weblinks to more information for items
		such as: gene descriptions, nucleotide positions, OMIM,
		pathways, phenotypes, and lists of interacting and neighboring
		genes. Annotation can then be used in R for further analysis,
		or the objects can be customized for use in spreadsheet
		programs or web browsers for users not familiar with R. Please
		see the website at http://NCBI2R.wordpress.com for more
		information. Internet access is required for almost all of
		these functions. Use the function PrintNCBI2RInfo() for
		information.
