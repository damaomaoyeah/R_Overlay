		Nonparametric tests of independence between random vectors. //
		Functions for testing mutual independence between many
		numerical random vectors or serial independence of a
		multivariate stationary sequence. The proposed test works when
		some or all of the marginal distributions are singular with
		respect to Lebesgue measure.
