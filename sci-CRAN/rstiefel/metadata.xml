		Random orthonormal matrix generation on the Stiefel manifold //
		This package simulates random orthonormal matrices from linear
		and quadratic exponential family distributions on the Stiefel
		manifold. The most general type of distribution covered is the
		matrix-variate  Bingham-von Mises-Fisher distribution. Most of
		the simulation methods are presented in Hoff(2009) "Simulation
		of the Matrix Bingham-von Mises-Fisher Distribution, With
		Applications to Multivariate and Relational Data."
