		Semidefinite Programming for Fitting Block Models of Equal Block
		Sizes // An ADMM implementation of SDP-1, a semidefinite
		programming relaxation of the maximum likelihood estimator for
		fitting a block model. SDP-1 has a tendency to produce equal-
		sized blocks and is ideal for producing a form of network
		histogram approximating a nonparametric graphon model.
		Alternatively, it can be used for community detection. (This is
		experimental code, proceed with caution.)
