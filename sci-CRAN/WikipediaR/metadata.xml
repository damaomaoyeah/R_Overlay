		R-Based Wikipedia Client // Provides an interface to the
		Wikipedia web application programming interface (API), using
		internet connexion.Three functions provide details for a
		specific Wikipedia page : all links that are present, all pages
		that link to, all the contributions (revisions for main pages,
		and discussions for talk pages). Two functions provide details
		for a specific user : all contributions, and general
		information (as name, gender, rights or groups). It provides
		additional information compared to others packages, as
		WikipediR. It does not need login. The multiplex network that
		can be constructed from the results of the functions of
		WikipediaR can be modeled as Stochastic Block Model as in
		Barbillon P., Donnet, S., Lazega E., and Bar-Hen A. :
		Stochastic Block Models for Multiplex networks: an application
		to networks of researchers, ArXiv 1501.06444,
