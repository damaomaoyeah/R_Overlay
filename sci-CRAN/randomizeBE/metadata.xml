		Function to create a random list for crossover studies //
		Contains a function to randomize subjects, patients in groups
		of sequences (treatment sequences).  If a blocksize is given,
		the randomization will be done within blocks.  The
		randomization may be controlled by a Wald-Wolfowitz runs test.
		Functions to obtain the p-value of that test are included.  The
		package is mainly intended for randomization of bioequivalence
		studies but may be used also for other clinical crossover
		studies.  Contains two helper functions sequences() and
		williams() to get the sequences of commonly used designs in BE
		studies.
