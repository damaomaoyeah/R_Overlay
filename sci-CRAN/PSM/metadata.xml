		Non-Linear Mixed-Effects modelling using Stochastic Differential
		Equations. // This package provides functions for estimation of
		linear and non-linear mixed-effects models using stochastic
		differential equations. Moreover it provides functions for
		finding smoothed estimates of model states and for simulation.
		The package allows for any multivariate non-linear time-variant
		model to be specified, and it also handles multidimensional
		input, co-variates, missing observations and specification of
		dosage regimen.
