		Tools for Working with ICD-9 Codes, and Finding Comorbidities //
		Obsolete: 'icd9' is replaced by CRAN package 'icd'. Calculate
		comorbidities, Charlson scores, perform fast and accurate
		validation, conversion, manipulation, filtering and comparison
		of ICD-9-CM (clinical modification) codes. ICD-9 codes appear
		numeric but leading and trailing zeroes, and both decimal and
		non-decimal "short" format codes exist. The package enables a
		work flow from raw lists of ICD-9 codes from hospital billing
		databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 to comorbidity mappings from
		Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ
		included. Any other mapping of codes, such as ICD-10, to
		comorbidities can be used.
