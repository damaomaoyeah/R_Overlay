		Nested Resolvable Designs and their Associated Uniform Designs //
		Construction method of nested resolvable designs from a
		projective geometry defined on Galois field of order 2. The
		obtained Resolvable designs are used to build uniform design.
		The presented results are based on https://eudml.org/doc/219563
		and A. Boudraa et al. (See references).
