		R API for Trello // Provides access to Trello API
		(https://developers.trello.com/). A family of GET functions
		make it easy to retrieve cards, labels, members, teams and
		other data from both public and private boards. Server
		responses are formatted upon retrieval. Automated paging allows
		for large requests that exceed server limit. See
		https://github.com/jchrom/trelloR for more information.
