		An Implementation of the Stratification Index // An
		implementation of the stratification index proposed by Zhou
		(2012) DOI:10.1177/0081175012452207. The package provides two
		functions, srank, which returns stratum-specific information,
		including population share and average percentile rank; and
		strat, which returns the stratification index and its
		approximate standard error. When a grouping factor is
		specified, strat also provides a detailed decomposition of the
		overall stratification into between-group and within-group
		components.
