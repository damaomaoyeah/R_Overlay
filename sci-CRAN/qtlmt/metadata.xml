		Tools for Mapping Multiple Complex Traits // Provides tools for
		joint analysis of multiple traits in a backcross (BC) or
		recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population. It can be used to
		select an optimal subset of traits for multiple-trait mapping,
		analyze multiple traits via the SURE model, which can associate
		different QTL with different traits, and perform multiple-trait
		composite multiple-interval mapping.
