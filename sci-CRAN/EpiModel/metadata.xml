		Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Disease // Tools for
		simulating mathematical models of infectious disease. Epidemic
		model classes include deterministic compartmental models,
		stochastic individual contact models, and stochastic network
		models. Disease types include SI, SIR, and SIS epidemics with
		and without demography, with tools available for expansion to
		model complex epidemic processes.
