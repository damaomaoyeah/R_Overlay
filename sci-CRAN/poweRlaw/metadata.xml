		Analysis of Heavy Tailed Distributions // An implementation of
		maximum likelihood estimators for a variety of heavy tailed
		distributions, including both the discrete and continuous power
		law distributions. Additionally, a goodness-of-fit based
		approach is used to estimate the lower cut-off for the scaling
		region.
