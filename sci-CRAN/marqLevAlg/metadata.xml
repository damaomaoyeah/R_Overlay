		An algorithm for least-squares curve fitting // This algorithm
		provides a numerical solution to the problem of minimizing a
		function. This is more efficient than the Gauss-Newton-like
		algorithm when starting from points very far from the final
		minimum. A new convergence test is implemented (RDM) in
		addition to the usual stopping criterion : stopping rule is
		when the gradients are small enough in the parameters metric
		(GH-1G).
