		Generator of Semi-Artificial Data // Package semiArtificial
		contains methods to generate and evaluate semi-artificial data
		sets. Based on a given data set different methods learn data
		properties using machine learning algorithms and generate new
		data with the same properties. The package currently includes
		the following data generator: -a RBF network based generator
		using rbfDDA from RSNNS package, -a Random Forest based
		generator for both classification and regression problems -a
		density forest based generator for unsupervised data Data
		evaluation support tools include: -single attribute based
		statistical evaluation: mean, median, standard deviation,
		skewness, kurtosis, medcouple, L/RMC, KS test, Hellinger
		distance -evaluation based on clustering using Adjusted Rand
		Index (ARI) and FM -evaluation based on classification
		performance with various learning models, eg, random forests.
