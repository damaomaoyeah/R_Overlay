		Generator of Semi-Artificial Data // Contains methods to generate
		and evaluate semi-artificial data sets. Based on a given data
		set different methods learn data properties using machine
		learning algorithms and generate new data with the same
		properties. The package currently includes the following data
		generators: i) a RBF network based generator using rbfDDA()
		from package 'RSNNS', ii) a Random Forest based generator for
		both classification and regression problems iii) a density
		forest based generator for unsupervised data Data evaluation
		support tools include: a) single attribute based statistical
		evaluation: mean, median, standard deviation, skewness,
		kurtosis, medcouple, L/RMC, KS test, Hellinger distance b)
		evaluation based on clustering using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
		and FM c) evaluation based on classification performance with
		various learning models, e.g., random forests.
