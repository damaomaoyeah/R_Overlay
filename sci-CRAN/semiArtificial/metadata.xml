		Generator of semi-artificial data // Package semiArtificial
		contains methods to generate and evaluate semi-artificial data
		sets. Based on a given data set different methods learn data
		properties using machine learning algorithms and generate new
		data with the same properties. The package currently includes
		the following data generator: -a RBF network based generator
		using rbfDDA from RSNNS package. More generators are planned in
		near future. Data evaluation support tools include: -single
		attribute based statistical evaluation: mean, median,standard
		deviation, skewness, kurtosis, KS test, Hellinger distance
		-evaluation based on clustering using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
		-evaluation based on classification performance with various
		learning models, eg, random forests.
