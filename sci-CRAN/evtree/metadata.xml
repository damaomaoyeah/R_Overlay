		Evolutionary Learning of Globally Optimal Trees // Commonly used
		classification and regression tree methods like the CART
		algorithm are recursive partitioning methods that build the
		model in a forward stepwise search. Although this approach is
		known to be an efficient heuristic, the results of recursive
		tree methods are only locally optimal, as splits are chosen to
		maximize homogeneity at the next step only. An alternative way
		to search over the parameter space of trees is to use global
		optimization methods like evolutionary algorithms. The 'evtree'
		package implements an evolutionary algorithm for learning
		globally optimal classification and regression trees in R. CPU
		and memory-intensive tasks are fully computed in C++ while the
		'partykit' package is leveraged to represent the resulting
		trees in R, providing unified infrastructure for summaries,
		visualizations, and predictions.
