		Reverse Ecology Analysis on Microbiome // An implementation of
		the reverse ecology framework. Reverse ecology refers to the
		use of genomics to study ecology with no a priori assumptions
		about the organism(s) under consideration, linking organisms to
		their environment. It allows researchers to reconstruct the
		metabolic networks and study the ecology of poorly
		characterized microbial species from their genomic information,
		and has substantial potentials for microbial community
		ecological analysis.
