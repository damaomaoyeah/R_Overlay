		Programmatic Conversion of PDF Tables // Allows the user to
		convert PDF tables to formats more amenable to analysis
		('.csv', '.xml', or '.xlsx') by wrapping the PDFTables API. In
		order to use the package, the user needs to sign up for an API
		account on the PDFTables website (https://pdftables.com/pdf-to-
		excel-api). The package works by taking a PDF file as input,
		uploading it to PDFTables, and returning a file with the
		extracted data.
