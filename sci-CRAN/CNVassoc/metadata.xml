		Association Analysis of CNV Data and Imputed SNPs // Carries out
		analysis of common Copy Number Variants (CNVs) and imputed
		Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in population-based
		studies. It includes tools for estimating association under a
		series of study designs (case-control, cohort, etc), using
		several dependent variables (class status, censored data,
		counts) as response, adjusting for covariates and considering
		various inheritance models. Moreover, it is possible to perform
		epistasis studies with pairs of CNVs or imputed SNPs. It has
		been optimized in order to make feasible the analyses of Genome
		Wide Association studies (GWAs) with hundreds of thousands of
		genetic variants (CNVs / imputed SNPs). Also, it incorporates
		functions for inferring copy number (CNV genotype calling).
		Various classes and methods for generic functions (print,
		summary, plot, anova, ...) have been created to facilitate the
		analysis.
