		Predict Information Cascade by Self-Exciting Point Process // An
		implementation of self-exciting point process model for
		information cascades, which occurs when many people engage in
		the same acts after observing the actions of others (e.g. post
		resharings on Facebook or Twitter). It provides functions to
		estimate the infectiousness of an information cascade and
		predict its popularity given the observed history. See
		http://snap.stanford.edu/seismic/ for more information and
		datasets.
