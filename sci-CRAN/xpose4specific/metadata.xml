		Xpose 4 Specific Functions Package // Xpose is collection of
		packages to be used as a model building aid for non-linear
		mixed effects (population) analysis using NONMEM. It

		model diagnostics, candidate covariate identification and model
		comparison. Xpose4specific is a package containing specific
		plotting functions, which require relatively little user input,
		but are less customizable than the plot commands found in
