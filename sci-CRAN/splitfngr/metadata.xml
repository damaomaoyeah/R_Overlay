		Combined Evaluation and Split Access of Functions // Some R
		functions, such as optim(), require a function its gradient
		passed as separate arguments. When these are expensive to
		calculate it may be much faster to calculate the function (fn)
		and gradient (gr) together since they often share many
		calculations (chain rule). This package allows the user to pass
		in a single function that returns both the function and
		gradient, then splits (hence 'splitfngr') them so the results
		can be accessed separately. The functions provided allow this
		to be done with any number of functions/values, not just for
		functions and gradients.
