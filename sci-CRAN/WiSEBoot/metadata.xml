		Wild Scale-Enhanced Bootstrap // Perform the Wild Scale-Enhanced
		(WiSE) bootstrap.  Specifically, the user may supply a single
		or multiple equally-spaced time series and use the WiSE
		bootstrap to select a wavelet-smoothed model.  Conversely, a
		pre-selected smooth level may also be specified for the time
		series.  Quantities such as the bootstrap sample of wavelet
		coefficients, smoothed bootstrap samples, and specific
		hypothesis testing and confidence region results of the wavelet
		coefficients may be obtained.  Additional functions are
		available to the user which help format the time series before
		analysis.  This methodology is recommended to aid in model
		selection and signal extraction. Note:  This package
		specifically uses wavelet bases in the WiSE bootstrap
		methodology, but the theoretical construct is much more
		versatile.
