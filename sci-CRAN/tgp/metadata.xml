		Bayesian Treed Gaussian Process Models // Bayesian nonstationary,
		semiparametric nonlinear regression and design by treed
		Gaussian processes (GPs) with jumps to the limiting linear
		model (LLM).  Special cases also implemented include Bayesian
		linear models, CART, treed linear models, stationary separable
		and isotropic GPs, and GP single-index models.  Provides 1-d
		and 2-d plotting functions (with projection and slice
		capabilities) and tree drawing, designed for visualization of
		tgp-class output.  Sensitivity analysis and multi-resolution
		models are supported. Sequential experimental design and
		adaptive sampling functions are also provided, including ALM,
		ALC, and expected improvement.  The latter supports derivative-
		free optimization of noisy black-box functions.
