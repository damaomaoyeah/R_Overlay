		Quickly Map and Explore Spatial Data // While analyzing
		geospatial data, easy visualization is often needed that allows
		for quick plotting, and simple, but easy interactivity.
		Additionally, visualizing geospatial data in projected
		coordinates is also desirable.  The 'quickmapr' package
		provides a simple method to visualize 'sp' and 'raster'
		objects, allows for basic zooming, panning, identifying, and
		labeling of spatial objects, and does not require that the data
		be in geographic coordinates.
