		Distributed Storage and List // An abstract DList class helps
		storing large list-type objects in a distributed manner.
		Corresponding high-level functions and methods for handling
		distributed storage (DStorage) and lists allows for processing
		such DLists on distributed systems efficiently. In doing so it
		uses a well defined storage backend implemented based on the
		DStorage class.
