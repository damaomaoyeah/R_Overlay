		Total Variation Denoising // Total Variation Denoising is a
		regularized denoising method which effectively removes noise
		from piecewise constant signals whilst preserving edges.  This
		package contains a C++ implementation of Condat's very fast 1D
		squared error loss TVD algorithm.  Additional methods and loss
		functions may be added in future versions.
