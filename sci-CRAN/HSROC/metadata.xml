		Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy when Reference Test is
		Imperfect // Implements a model for joint meta-analysis of
		sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test under
		evaluation, while taking into account the possibly imperfect
		sensitivity and specificity of the reference test. This
		hierarchical model accounts for both within and between study
		variability. Estimation is carried out using a Bayesian
		approach, implemented via a Gibbs sampler. The model can be
		applied in situations where more than one reference test is
		used in the selected studies.
