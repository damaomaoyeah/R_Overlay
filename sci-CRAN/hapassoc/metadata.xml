		Inference of Trait Associations with SNP Haplotypes and Other
		Attributes using the EM Algorithm // The following R functions
		are used for inference of trait associations with haplotypes
		and other covariates in generalized linear models.  The
		functions are developed primarily for data collected in cohort
		or cross-sectional studies. They can accommodate uncertain
		haplotype phase and handle missing genotypes at some SNPs.
