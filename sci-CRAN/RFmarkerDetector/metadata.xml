		Multivariate Analysis of Metabolomics Data using Random Forests
		// A collection of tools for multivariate analysis of
		metabolomics data, which includes several preprocessing methods
		(normalization, scaling) and various exploration and data
		visualization techniques (Principal Components Analysis and
		Multi Dimensional Scaling). The core of the package is the
		Random Forest algorithm used for the construction, optimization
		and validation of classification models with the aim of
		identifying potentially relevant biomarkers.
