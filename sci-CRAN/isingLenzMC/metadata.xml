		Monte Carlo for Classical Ising Model // Classical Ising Model is
		a land mark system in statistical physics. Model explains
		physics of spin glasses and magnetic materials, but used in
		many different context for example phase transitions and neural
		systems. This package provides utilities to simulate one
		dimensional Ising Model with Metropolis and Glauber Monte Carlo
		with single flip dynamics in periodic boundary conditions.
