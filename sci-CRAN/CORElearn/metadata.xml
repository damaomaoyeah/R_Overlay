		Classification, Regression and Feature Evaluation // This is a
		suite of machine learning algorithms written in C++ with R
		interface. It contains several machine learning model learning
		techniques in classification and regression, for example
		classification and regression trees with optional constructive
		induction and models in the leaves, random forests, kNN, naive
		Bayes, and locally weighted regression. All predictions
		obtained with these models can be explained and visualized with
		ExplainPrediction package. The package is especially strong in
		feature evaluation where it contains several variants of Relief
		algorithm and many impurity based attribute evaluation
		functions, e.g., Gini, information gain, MDL, and DKM. These
		methods can be used for example to discretize numeric
		attributes. Its additional feature is OrdEval algorithm and its
		visualization used for evaluation of data sets with ordinal
		features and class, enabling analysis according to the Kano
		model of customer satisfaction. Several algorithms support
		parallel multithreaded execution via OpenMP. The top-level
		documentation is reachable through ?CORElearn.
