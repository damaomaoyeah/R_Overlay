		Classification, Regression and Feature Evaluation // This is a
		suite of machine learning algorithms written in C++ with R
		interface. It contains several machine learning model learning
		techniques in classification and regression, for example
		classification and regression trees with optional constructive
		induction and models in the leaves, random forests, kNN, naive
		Bayes, and locally weighted regression. It is especially strong
		in feature evaluation where it contains several variants of
		Relief algorithm and many impurity based attribute evaluation
		functions, e.g., Gini, information gain, MDL, DKM. These
		methods can be used for example to discretize numeric
		attributes. Its additional strength is OrdEval algorithm and
		its visualization used for evaluation of data sets with ordinal
		features and class enabling analysis according to the Kano
		model. Several algorithms support parallel multithreaded
		execution via OpenMP. The top-level documentation is reachable
		through ?CORElearn.
