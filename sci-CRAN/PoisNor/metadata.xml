		Simultaneous generation of multivariate data with Poisson and
		normal marginals // A package for simulating multivariate data
		with count and continuous variables with a pre-specified
		correlation matrix. The count and continuous variables are
		assumed to have Poisson and normal marginals, respectively. The
		data generation mechanism is a combination of the normal to
		anything principle and a connection between Poisson and normal
		correlations in the mixture.
