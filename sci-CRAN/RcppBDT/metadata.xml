		Rcpp bindings for the Boost Date_Time library // This package
		provides R with access to Boost Date_Time functionality by
		using Rcpp modules. . Functionality from Boost Date_Time for
		dates, durations (both for days and datetimes), timezones, and
		posix time ("ptime") is provided. The posix time implementation
		can support high-resolution of up to nano-second precision by
		using 96 bits (instead of R's 64) to present a ptime object.
