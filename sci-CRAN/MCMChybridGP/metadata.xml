		Hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo using Gaussian Processes //
		Hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to simulate from a
		multimodal target distribution.  A Gaussian process
		approximation makes this possible when derivatives are unknown.
		The Package serves to minimize the number of function
		evaluations in Bayesian calibration of computer models using
		parallel tempering.  It allows replacement of the true target
		distribution in high temperature chains, or complete
		replacement of the target.  Methods used are described in,
		"Efficient MCMC schemes for Bayesian calibration of computer
		models", Fielding, Mark, Nott, David J. and Liong Shie-Yui,
		Technometrics (2010). The authors gratefully acknowledge the
		support  contributions of the Singapore-Delft Water Alliance
		(SDWA).  The research presented in this work was carried out as
		part of the SDWA's Multi-Objective Multi-Reservoir Management
		research programme (R-264-001-272).
