		MultiClass Visualizable Classification using Combination of
		Projections // An ensemble classifier for multiclass
		classification. This is a novel classifier that natively works
		as an ensemble. It projects data on a large number of matrices,
		and uses very simple classifiers on each of these projections.
		The results are then combined, ideally via Dempster-Shafer
		Calculus.
