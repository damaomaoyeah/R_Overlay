		Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data // A set of
		tools that solves a common set of problems: you need to break a
		big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each piece
		and then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you
		might want to fit a model to each spatial location or time
		point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse high-
		dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The
		development of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton
		Dickinson'.
