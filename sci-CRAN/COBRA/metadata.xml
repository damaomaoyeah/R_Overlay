		Nonlinear Aggregation of Predictors // This package performs
		prediction for regression-oriented problems, aggregating in a
		nonlinear scheme any basic regression machines suggested by the
		context and provided by the user. If the user has no valuable
		knowledge on the data, four defaults machines wrappers are
		implemented so as to cover a minimal spectrum of prediction
		methods. If necessary, the computations may be parallelized.
		The method is described in Biau, Fischer, Guedj and Malley
		(2013), "COBRA: A Nonlinear Aggregation Strategy".
