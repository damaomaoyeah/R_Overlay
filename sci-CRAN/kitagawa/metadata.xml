		Spectral response of water wells to harmonic strain and pressure
		// Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic
		response of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining or
		pressurization. There are two classes of models here: (1) for
		sealed wells, based on the model of Kitagawa et al (2011), and
		(2) for open wells, based on the models of Cooper et al (1965),
		Hsieh et al (1987), Rojstaczer (1988), and Liu et al (1989).
		These models treat strain (or aquifer head) as an input to the
		physical system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the
		output. The applicable frequency band of these models is
		characteristic of seismic waves, atmospheric pressure
		fluctuations, and solid earth tides.
