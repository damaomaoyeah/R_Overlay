		Summary charts of micro satellite profiles for a set of
		biological samples // Gene banks increasingly use molecular
		markers for routine characterization of plant collections and
		farmer managed diversity. The gene bank of the International
		Potato Center presently uses a micro-satellite marker kit to
		produce molecular profiles for potato accessions. We have been
		searching for a compact graphical representation that shows
		both molecular diversity and accession characteristics - thus
		permitting biologists and collection curators to have a simple
		way to interpret molecular data. Inspired by the ancient Andean
		data recording system we devised a graph that allows for
		standardized representation while leaving room for updates of
		the marker kit and the collection of accessions. The graph has
		been used in several catalogs of potatoes.
