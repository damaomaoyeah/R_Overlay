		Estimation and Use of the Generalised (Tukey) Lambda Distribution
		// The  generalised lambda distribution, or Tukey lambda
		distribution, provides a wide variety of shapes with one
		functional form. This package provides random numbers,
		quantiles, probabilities, densities and density quantiles for
		four different parameterisations of the distribution. It
		provides the density function, distribution function, and
		Quantile-Quantile plots. It implements a variety of estimation
		methods for the distribution, including diagnostic plots.
		Estimation methods include the starship (all 4
		parameterisations) and a number of methods for only the FKML
		parameterisation. These include maximum likelihood, maximum
		product of spacings, Titterington's method, Moments, L-Moments,
		Trimmed L-Moments and Distributional Least Absolutes.
