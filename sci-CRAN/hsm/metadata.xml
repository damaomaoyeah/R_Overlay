		A Path-Based BCD for Proximal Function of Latent Group Lasso //
		Implementation of the block coordinate descent procedure for
		solving the proximal function of latent group Lasso,
		highlighted by decomposing a DAG into several non-overlapping
		path graphs, and getting closed-form solution for each path
		graph. The procedure was introduced as Algorithm 4 in Yan and
		Bien (2015) https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01631 "Hierarchical
		Sparse Modeling: A Choice of Two Regularizers", and the closed-
		form solution for each path graph is solved in Algorithm 3 of
		that paper.
