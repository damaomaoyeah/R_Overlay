		Supervised Weight of Evidence Binning of Numeric Variables and
		Factors // Implements an automated binning of numeric variables
		and factors with respect to a dichotomous target variable. Two
		approaches are provided: An implementation of fine and coarse
		classing that merges granular classes and levels step by step.
		And a tree-like approach that iteratively segments the initial
		bins via binary splits. Both procedures merge, respectively
		split, bins based on similar weight of evidence (WOE) values
		and stop via an information value (IV) based criteria. The
		package can be used with single variables or an entire data
		frame. It provides flexible tools for exploring different
		binning solutions and for deploying them to (new) data.
