		Supervised WOE Binning of Numeric Variables and Factors //
		Implements an automated fine and coarse classing to bin numeric
		variables and factors with respect to a dichotomous target
		variable. Numeric variables are binned by merging a specified
		initial number of bins with similar frequencies. As a start
		sparse bins are merged with adjacent ones. Afterwards nearby
		bins with most similar WOE values are joined step by step until
		the information value (IV) decreases more than specified by a
		percentage value. Factors are binned by merging factor levels.
		At the beginning sparse levels are merged to a 'miscellaneous'
		level. Afterwards bins with most similar WOE values are joined
		step by step until the IV decreases more than specified by a
		percentage value. The package can be used with single variables
		or an entire data frame. It provides flexible tools for
		exploring different binning solutions and for deploying them to
		(new) data.
