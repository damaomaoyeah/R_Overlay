		RNA-Seq Power Simulation // Provides functions for estimating
		power or sample size for RNA-Seq studies. Empirical approach is
		used and the data is assumed to be count in nature. The
		underlying distribution of data is assumed to be Poisson or
		negative binomial. The package contains 6 function; 4 functions
		provide estimates of sample size or power for Poisson and
		Negative Binomial distribution; 2 functions provide plots of
		power for given sample size or sample size for given power.
