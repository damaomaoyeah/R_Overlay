		Bayesian Effect Fusion for Categorical Predictors // Variable
		selection and Bayesian effect fusion for categorical predictors
		in linear regression models. Effect fusion aims at the question
		which categories have a similar effect on the response and
		therefore can be fused to obtain a sparser representation of
		the model. Effect fusion and variable selection can be obtained
		either with a prior that has an interpretation as spike and
		slab prior on the level effect differences or with a sparse
		finite mixture prior on the level effects. The regression
		coefficients are estimated with a flat uninformative prior
		after model selection or model averaged. For posterior
		inference, an MCMC sampling scheme is used that involves only
		Gibbs sampling steps.
