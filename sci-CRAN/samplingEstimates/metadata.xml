		Sampling Estimates // Functions to estimate from survey data.
		This package is a user-friendly wrapper of the samplingVarEst
		package. It considers that the user is more familiar with
		practical survey data rather than with research on survey
		sampling (variance estimation). More functionalities are on the
		way.
