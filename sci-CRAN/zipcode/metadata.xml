		U.S. ZIP Code database for geocoding // This package contains a
		database of city, state, latitude, and longitude information
		for U.S. ZIP codes from the CivicSpace Database (August 2004)
		augmented by Daniel Coven's federalgovernmentzipcodes.us web
		site (updated January 22, 2012). Previous versions of this
		package (before 1.0) were based solely on the CivicSpace data,
		so an original version of the CivicSpace database is also
		included.
