		Diagnostics plots for Bicluster Data // Diagnostic tools based on
		two-way anova and median-polish residual plots for Bicluster
		output obtained from packages; "biclust" by Kaiser et
		al.(2008),"isa2" by Csardi et al. (2010) and "fabia" by
		Hochreiter et al. (2010). Moreover, It provides visualization
		tools for bicluster output and corresponding non-bicluster
		rows- or columns outcomes.  It has also extended the idea of
		Kaiser et al.(2008) which is, extracting bicluster output in a
		text format, by adding two bicluster methods from the fabia and
		isa2 R packages.
