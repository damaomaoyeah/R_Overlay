		Construction of diagnostic or prognostic scoring system and
		internal validation of its discriminative capacities based on
		ROC curve and 0.633+ boostrap resampling. // This package
		computes traditional ROC curves and time-dependent ROC curves
		using the cross-validation, the 0.632 and the 0.632+
		estimators. The 0.632+ estimator of time-dependent ROC curve is
		useful to estimate the predictive accuracy of prognostic
		signature based on high-dimensional data. For instance, it
		outperforms the other approaches, especially the cross-
		validation solution which is often used. The 0.632+ estimators
		correct the area under the curve in order to adequately
		estimate the prognostic capacities regardless of the
		overfitting level. This package also allows for the
		construction of diagnostic or prognostic scoring systems
		(penalized regressions). The methodology is adapted to complete
		data (penalized logistic regression associated with ROC curve)
		or incomplete time-to-event data (penalized Cox model
		associated with time-dependent ROC curve).
