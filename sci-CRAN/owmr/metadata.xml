		OpenWeatherMap API Wrapper // Accesses OpenWeatherMap's (owm)
		https://openweathermap.org/ API. 'owm' itself is a service
		providing weather data in the past, in the future and now.
		Furthermore, 'owm' serves weather map layers usable in
		frameworks like 'leaflet'. In order to access the API, you need
		to sign up for an API key. There are free and paid plans.
		Beside functions for fetching weather data from 'owm', 'owmr'
		supplies tools to tidy up fetched data (for fast and simple
		access) and to show it on leaflet maps.
