		Fitting Linear Models with Endogenous Regressors using Latent
		Instrumental Variables // Fits linear models with endogenous
		regressor using latent instrumental variable approaches. The
		methods included in the package are Lewbel's (1997) higher
		moments approach as well as Lewbel's (2012) heteroskedasticity
		approach, Park and Gupta's (2012) joint estimation method that
		uses Gaussian copula and Kim and Frees's (2007) multilevel
		generalized method of moment approach that deals with
		endogeneity in a multilevel setting. These are statistical
		techniques to address the endogeneity problem where no external
		instrumental variables are needed.
