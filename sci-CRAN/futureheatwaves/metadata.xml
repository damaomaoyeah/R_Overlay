		Find, Characterize, and Explore Heat Waves in Climate Projections
		// Inputs a directory of climate projection files and, for
		each, identifies and characterizes heat waves for specified
		study locations. The definition used to identify heat waves can
		be customized. Heat wave characterizations include several
		metrics of heat wave length, intensity, and timing in the year.
		The heat waves that are identified can be explored using a
		function to apply user-created functions across all generated
		heat wave files.This work was supported in part by grants from
		the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
		(R00ES022631), the National Science Foundation (1331399), and
		the Colorado State University Vice President for Research.
