		Robust Selection of Cluster Number K // Facilitates optimal
		clustering of a data set. Provides a framework to run a wide
		range of clustering algorithms to determine the optimal number
		(k) of clusters in the data. Then analyzes the cluster
		assignments from each clustering algorithm to identify samples
		that repeatedly classify to the same group. We call these 'core
		clusters', providing a basis for later class discovery.
