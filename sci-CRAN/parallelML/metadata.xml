		A Parallel-Voting Algorithm for many Classifiers // By sampling
		your data, running the provided classifier on these samples in
		parallel on your own machine and letting your models vote on a
		prediction, we return much faster predictions than the regular
		machine learning algorithm and possibly even more accurate
		predictions.
