		Convert labels or tables to a dendrogram // The package offers a
		dendrogram representation of series of labels, this is
		specially needed in Markov chain Monte Carlo clustering. If you
		have a dendrogram in your mind you can easily put series of
		meaningful labels in a matrix and heights in a vector, then
		convert them to a dendrogram abject.
