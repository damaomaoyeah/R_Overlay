		Fast and URL-Safe Base64 Encoder and Decoder // In contrast to
		RFC3548, the 62nd character ("+") is replaced with "-", the
		63rd character ("/") is replaced with "_". Furthermore, the
		encoder does not fill the string with trailing "=". The
		resulting encoded strings comply to the regular expression
		pattern "[A-Za-z0-9_-]" and thus are safe to use in URLs or for
		file names.
