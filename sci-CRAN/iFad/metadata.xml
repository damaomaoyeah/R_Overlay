		An integrative factor analysis model for drug-pathway association
		inference // This package implements a Bayesian sparse factor
		model for the joint analysis of paired datasets, one is the
		gene expression dataset and the other is the drug sensitivity
		profiles, measured across the same panel of samples, e.g., cell
		lines. Prior knowledge about gene-pathway associations can be
		easily incorporated in the model to aid the inference of drug-
		pathway associations.
