		Generalized Nonlinear Models // Functions to specify and fit
		generalized nonlinear models, including models with
		multiplicative interaction terms such as the UNIDIFF model from
		sociology and the AMMI model from crop science, and many
		others.  Over-parameterized representations of models are used
		throughout; functions are provided for inference on estimable
		parameter combinations, as well as standard methods for
		diagnostics etc.
