		Quality speedy graphics compilation and caching with Sweave //
		pgfSweave provides a number of improvements to the speed and
		quality of Sweave output including: (1) capabilities for
		'caching' graphics generated with Sweave on top of the caching
		mechanisms provided by cacheSweave, (2) an interface to the
		tikzDevice package which provides graphics with consistent font
		style, sizing and quality as the main document and (3)
		highlighting of echo'd source code via the highlight package.
		pgfSweave provides a new driver for Sweave (pgfSweaveDriver)
		with new chunk options tikz, external, sanitize, highlight and
		tidy on top of the cache option provided by cacheSweave.
