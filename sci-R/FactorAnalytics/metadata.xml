		Functions for performing factor analysis on financial time series
		// A package of functions that may be used to perform various
		factor analyses on financial time series.  The package includes
		functions that calculate style weights using an asset class
		style model as described in detail in Sharpe (1992).  The use
		of quadratic programming to determine a fund's exposures to the
		changes in returns of major asset classes is usually refered to
		as "style analysis".
