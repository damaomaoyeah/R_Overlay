		Rcpp bindings for NumPy files // This package provides R with
		access to the cnpy library written by Carl Rogers which
		provides read and write facilities for files created with (or
		for) the NumPy extension for Python.  Vectors and matrices of
		numeric types can be read or written to and from files as well
		as compressed files. Support for integer files is available if
		the package has been built with -std=c++0x or -std=c++11 which
		is needed for long long int support.
