		Functions for nonlinear least squares solutions // nlmrt provides
		tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems using a
		calling structure similar to, but much simpler than, that of
		the nls() function. Moreover, where nls() specifically does NOT
		deal with small or zero residual problems, nlmrt is quite happy
		to solve them. It also attempts to be more robust in finding
		solutions, thereby avoiding 'singular gradient' messages that
		arise in the Gauss-Newton method within nls(). The Marquardt-
		Nash approach in nlmrt generally works more reliably to get a
		solution, though this may be one of a set of possibilities, and
		may also be statistically unsatisfactory. Added print and
		summary as of August 28, 2012.
