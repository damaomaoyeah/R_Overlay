		ExactSampling: risk evaluation using exact resampling methods for
		the k Nearest Neighbor algorithm. // ExactSampling contains
		functions that estimate the risk associated to a kNN prediction
		function (either in regression or binary classification) based
		on resampling method (leave-p-out cross-validation or
		bootstrap). It also contain a function knn.search to obtain the
		list of k nearest neighbors for each point in the sample, and a
		function to compute the empirical risk of a kNN prediction
		function.
