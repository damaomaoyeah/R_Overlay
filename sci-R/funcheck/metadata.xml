		OBSOLETE: Run tests, where possible, on named optimization
		problem file. // This package is obsolete and should not be
		used. Provides a way to check the file fname.R that contains
		various functions that compute the objective function,
		gradient, Hessian, residuals, Jacobian, Jacobian second
		derivatives and setup for functions used to test optimization
		routines. A second function funtest allows the individual
		function names to be given. Redated to force R-forge build.
