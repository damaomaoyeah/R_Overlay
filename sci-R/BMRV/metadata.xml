		Bayesian Models for Rare Variant Association Analysis // Provides
		two Bayesian models for detecting the association between rare
		variants and traits that can be continuous, ordinal or binary.
		Bayesian latent variable collapsing model (BLVCM) detects
		interaction effect and is dedicated to twin design while it can
		also be applied to independent samples. Hierarchical Bayesian
		multiple regression model (HBMR) incorporates genotype
		uncertainty information and can be applied to either
		independent or family samples. Furthermore, it deals with
		continuous, binary and ordinal traits.
