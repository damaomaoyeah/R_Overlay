		rbrothers: multiple change-point recombination detection //
		rbrothers is a phylogenetic recombination detection package.
		Starting with aligned DNA sequences, rbrothers uses the
		Bayesian multiple change-point model implemented in the JAVA
		package DualBrothers to create posterior tree probability
		plots. rbrothers automates the production of a reasonable set
		of candidate trees and provides trace plots and autocorrelation
		plots that allow the user to monitor the convergence and mixing
		of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.
