		Panel Data Analysis with Heterogeneous Time Trends // The package
		provides estimation procedures for panel data with large
		dimensions n, T, and general forms of unobservable
		heterogeneous effects. Particularly, the estimation procedures
		are those of Bai (2009) and Kneip, Sickles, and Song (2012),
		which complement one another very well: both models assume the
		unobservable heterogeneous effects to have a factor structure.
		The method of Bai (2009) assumes that the factors are
		stationary, whereas the method of Kneip et al. (2012) allows
		the factors to be non-stationary. Additionally, the 'phtt'
		package provides a wide range of dimensionality criteria in
		order to estimate the number of the unobserved factors
		simultaneously with the remaining model parameters.
