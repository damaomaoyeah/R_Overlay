		Process Accelerometer Data from NHANES 2003-2006 // Functions for
		processing accelerometer data from the National Health and
		Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), years 2003-2006 (data
		included). The main function, nhanes.accel.process, generates a
		variety of physical activity variables, including indicators of
		physical activity volume, intensity, frequency, and duration.
		It also generates variables that can be used to study patterns
		of physical activity, i.e. weekday/weekend differences and
		hourly trends. Numerous function inputs are available to
		control data processing algorithms like non-wear time
		classification and activity bout detection.
