		Qualitative Validation Methods // Qualitative methods for the
		validation of dynamic models. It contains (i) an orthogonal set
		of deviance measures for absolute, relative and ordinal scale
		and (ii) approaches accounting for time shifts. The first
		approach transforms time to take time delays and speed
		differences into account. The second divides the time series
		into interval units according to their main features and finds
		the longest common subsequence (LCS) using a dynamic
		programming algorithm.
