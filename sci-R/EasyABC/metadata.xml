		Efficient Approximate Bayesian Computation Sampling Schemes //
		Enables launching a series of simulations of a computer code
		from the R session, and to retrieve the simulation outputs in
		an appropriate format for post-processing treatments. Five
		sequential sampling schemes and three coupled-to-MCMC schemes
		are implemented.
