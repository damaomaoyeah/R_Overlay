		Tools for Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) of Arrayed
		Microbial Cultures Growing on Solid Agar Surfaces //
		Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) is a complementary series
		of experimental and computational methods for estimating the
		fitness of thousands of microbial cultures in parallel.  QFA is
		suitable for focussed, high-quality studies of the effect of
		genetic mutations or drug interventions on growth in model
		microbial organisms such as brewer's yeast.  Culture growth is
		observed by time-lapse photography of solid agar plates
		inoculated with cultures in rectangular arrays.  Growth curves
		are constructed by analysing image series using Colonyzer image
		analysis software  (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer) which
		converts images to arrays of cell density estimates.  This R
		package is for a) fitting the generalised logistic model to
		potentially thousands of parallel growth curves, b) using
		inferred parameter values to calculate fitnesses for each
		culture and c) comparing fitnesses between QFA experiments with
		different genetic backgrounds or treatments to deduce
		interaction strengths.  This package facilitates quantifying
		the fitness of thousands of independent microbial strains and
		tracking them throughout growth curve experiments.  With
		appropriately designed experiments, qfa can also estimate
		genetic interaction strengths and produce epistasis plots.
