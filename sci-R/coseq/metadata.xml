		Clustering Analysis of Sequencing Data // Gaussian and Poisson
		mixture models are implemented to cluster biological entities
		(e.g., genes) from high-throughput sequencing data. Parameter
		estimation is performed using the EM algorithm and model
		selection criteria (to choose the number of clusters) are
		provided.
