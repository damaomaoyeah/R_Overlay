		hwriter5: Writing HTML5 from R // This package writes HTML from
		R. The facilities provided by the package are similar to those
		available in hwriterPlus, which in turn is an extension of the
		hwriter package. The major difference between this package and
		its predecessors is that the HTML produced is HTML5 compliant.
