		Networking Genetic Evidence to Prioritise Drug Targets at the
		Gene, Pathway and Network Level // Priority index or Pi is
		developed as a genomic-led target prioritisation system, with
		the focus on leveraging genetic data to prioritise targets at
		the gene and pathway level. Based on evidence of genetic
		association from GWAS data, this prioritisation system is able
		to resolve modulated genes (seed genes) by utilising knowledge
		of linkage disequilibrium (co-inherited variants), distance
		from the gene, and evidence of genetic association with gene
		expression. Seed genes are scored in an integrative way
		quantifying the genetic influence. Scored seed genes are
		subsequently used as baits to rank seed genes plus additional
		(non-seed) genes; this is achieved by iteratively exploring the
		global connectivity of a gene interaction network. Genes with
		the top priority are further used to identify/prioritise
		pathways that are significantly enriched with highly
		prioritised genes. Prioritised genes are also used to identify
		a gene network interconnecting many highly prioritised genes
		but a few lowly prioritised genes as linkers.
