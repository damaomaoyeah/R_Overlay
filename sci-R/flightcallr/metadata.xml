		Classify Night Flight Calls Based on Acoustic Measurements //
		flightcallr uses the seewave package to generate acoustic
		measurements ("features") of sounds, and then trains and uses
		random forest models to make predictions based on these
		features. Accuracy can be constrained via cross-validation.
		Convenience functions for reading and writing Raven selection
		tables are included.
