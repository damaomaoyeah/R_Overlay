		Misc Tools of the Department of Biostatistics, EBPI, University
		of Zurich // Various functions developed at the Department of
		Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention
		Institute, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland. Currently
		implemented topics: several CI's for proportions, Fagan-
		Nomogram, bootstrap CI's for the kappa coefficient, intraclass-
		correlation coefficients including CI's, agreement for
		continuous measurements (Bland-Altman plot), CI for the area
		under the curve (AUC), Mantel-Haenszel estimator, Mantel-Cox
		hazard ratio estimator, CI for the Kaplan-Meier estimate at
		given time points, CI for quantile of a Kaplan-Meier or
		cumulative incidence estimate, sample size computations for
		two-sample Mann-Whitney test, McNemar test, binary diagnostic
		test (via normal approximation and simulation), natural re-
		parametrization of Weibull output from survreg, hazard ratio
		and event time ratio interpretations, a plot to check the
		adequacy of the Weibull model.
