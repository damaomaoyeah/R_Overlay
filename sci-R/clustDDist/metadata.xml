		Clustering Discrete Distributions // Clustering of units
		described with distributions is considered. Frequent approach
		for clustering such data combines non-hierarchical method (to
		allow clustering of large amount of units) with hierarchical
		clustering method (to build dendrogram from the obtained
		nonhierarchical clusters and determine the most 'natural' final
		clustering(s) from it). The use of the squared Euclidean
		distance as an error function favors patterns of distributions
		that have one steep high peak. Here several alternative error
		functions are implemented. They characterize errors between
		clustered units and a cluster representative - leader (which
		needs not be defined in the same space). For these error
		functions the adapted leaders methods and compatible
		agglomerative hierarchical clustering methods are implemented.
