		rpubchem - Interface to the PubChem Collection // Access PubChem
		data (compounds, substance, assays). Structural information is
		provided in the form of SMILES strings. This package only
		provides access to a subset of the precalculated data stored by
		PubChem. Bio-assay data can be accessed to obtain descriptions
		as well as the actual data. It is also possible to search for
		assay ID's by keyword. Currently the main limitation is that
		only 1000 molecules can be downloaded at a time from the
		PubChem servers
