		Estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses for FDR // This
		package implements method(s) to (approximately unbiasedly)
		estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses, i.e., the pi0,
		when a very large number of hypotheses are simultaneously
		tested, especially for the purpose of (local) false discovery
		rate control for microarray data. It also contains functions to
		estimate the distribution of noncentrality parameters from a
		large number of parametric tests.
