		Compute the design effect for correlated binary data // This
		package implements  the method in Brown and Jiang (2009),
		"Intraclass Correlation and the Design Effect for Binary Random
		Effects Models", unpublished. Computes the intraclass
		correlation, the design effect, and standard errors for the
		intercept for a binary-valued model with a group-level random
		effect, when the number of groups and number of observations
		per group are specified.
