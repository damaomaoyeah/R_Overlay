		Smooth models for interval-censored data with applications to
		survival and illness-death models // SmoothHazard is a package
		for fitting illness-death (and survival) model with possibly
		interval-censored data for transition toward transient state.
		Left-truncated and right-censored data are also allowed.
		Proportional intensities regression models allow for covariates
		on each of the 3 transitions. We use either a parametric
		approach with Weibull baseline intensities or a semi-parametric
		approach with M-splines approximation of baseline intensities
		in order to obtain smooth estimates. Estimation of parameters
		is conducted by likelihood maximization in the parametric
		approach or penalized likelihood maximization in the semi-
		parametric approach.
