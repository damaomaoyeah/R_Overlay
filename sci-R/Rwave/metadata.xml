		Time-Frequency analysis of 1-D signals // Rwave is a library of R
		functions which provide an environment for the Time-Frequency
		analysis of 1-D signals (and especially for the wavelet and
		Gabor transforms of noisy signals). It was originally written
		for Splus by Rene Carmona, Bruno Torresani, and Wen L. Hwang,
		first at the University of California at Irvine and then at
		Princeton University.  Credit should also be given to Andrea
		Wang whose functions on the dyadic wavelet transform are
		included. Rwave is based on the book: "Practical Time-Frequency
		Analysis: Gabor and Wavelet Transforms with an Implementation
		in S", by Rene Carmona, Wen L. Hwang and Bruno Torresani,
		Academic Press, 1998. This package is no longer actively
		maintained.  A C++ rewrite of core functionality is in
		progress. If you'd like to participate, please contact
		Christian Gunning.
