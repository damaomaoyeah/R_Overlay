		Use multiple feature selection algorithms to derive robust
		feature sets for two or multiclass classification problems. //
		To select a set of features used for successful classification
		of two or more groups of samples, multiple classification and
		feature selection algorithms are utilised. By combining the
		results of all methods and applying a bootstrapping approach a
		robust set of features with high power to distinguish the
		sample groups is selected.
