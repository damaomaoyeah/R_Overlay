		Derive Robust Feature Sets for Two or Multiclass Classification
		Problems // In order to select a set of features used for
		successful classification of two or more groups of samples,
		multiple classification and feature selection algorithms are
		utilised. By combining the results of all methods and applying
		a bootstrapping approach a robust set of features with high
		power to distinguish the sample groups is selected.
