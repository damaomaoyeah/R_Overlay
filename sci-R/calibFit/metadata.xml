		Statistical models and tools for assay calibration // Provides
		basic S4 data structures and routines for calibration of
		bioassays. A variety of linear and nonlinear calibration curves
		can be fit to data. Most models have a Power of the Mean option
		for nonconstant variances. Unknown concentrations can be
		predicted from the calibration curve.
