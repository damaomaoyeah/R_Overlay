		Modeling Animal Movement with Continuous-Time Discrete-Space
		Markov Chains // This package facilitates taking movement data
		in xyt format and pairing it with raster covariates within a
		continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) framework.  As described in
		Hanks et al. (2015), this allows flexible modeling of movement
		in response to covariates (or covariate gradients) with model
		fitting possible within a Poisson GLM framework.
