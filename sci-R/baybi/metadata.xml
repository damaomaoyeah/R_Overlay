		Bayesian Biclustering with Subject and Variable Importance // The
		package builds a dendrogram for subjects and variables with log
		posterior of a simple linear model. After data are grouped the
		Bayes Factor of a mixture versus a single component is given as
		an importance measure. Model hyperparameters are needed to be
		given or estimated from data to apply the algorithm.
