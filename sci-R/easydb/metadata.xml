		Generic S3 Classes for Simple Database Interfaces // Generic S3
		classes for simple database interfaces. (presently RODBC and
		RSQLite). 'easydb' provide common S3 classes for reading,
		writing, listing and subsetting tables in RODBC and (R)SQLite
		databases. Functions in 'easydb' alone DO NOT provide any
		database interface, but they are used in other packages that
		provide inteface to various database systems (see suggests).
		'easydb' allows to retrieve, write and subset database's tables
		in a similar way as data.frame's, using single square brackets
		db[,,,]. easydb internalise many database operations (otherwise
		tedious) such as rows and columns subsetting (no SQL needed)
		and connection and disconnection to / from databases.
