		Analysis of Stable Matchings // Implements structural estimators
		to correct for the sample selection bias from observed outcomes
		in matching markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents
		into groups as well as two-sided matching of students to
		schools. The package also contains R code for three matching
		algorithms: the deferred-acceptance (or Gale-Shapley) algorithm
		for stable marriage and college admissions problems, the top-
		trading-cycles algorithm for house allocation and a
		partitioning linear programme for the roommates problem.
