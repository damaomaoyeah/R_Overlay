		Analysis of large Affymetrix microarray data sets // This package
		implements classes for files and sets of files for various
		Affymetrix file formats, e.g. AffymetrixCdfFile,
		AffymetrixCelFile, and AffymetrixCelSet.  These are designed to
		be memory efficient but still being fast.  The idea is to keep
		all data on file and only read data into memory when needed.
		Clever caching mechanisms are used to minimize the overhead of
		data IO.  All of the above is hidden in the package API and for
		the developer (and the end user), the data is queried as if it
		lives in memory.  With this design it is only the disk space
		that limits the number of arrays that can be analyzed.
