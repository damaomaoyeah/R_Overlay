		Generating numeric sequence items for intelligence tests // This
		package helps to generate items for intelligence tests. Items
		are number sequences and are generated according to the
		implemented basic rules. Those rules can be easily combined
		either by a user or automatically. The package generates also
		'noise answers' (distractors) helpful in creating items with
		specified response options.
