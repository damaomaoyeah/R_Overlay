		Sparse group lasso optimizer // Fast algorithm for solving the
		sparse group lasso convex optimization problem. This package
		apply template metaprogramming techniques, therefore -- when
		compiling the package from source -- a high level of
		optimization is needed to gain full speed (e.g. for the GCC
		compiler use -O3). Use of multiple processors for cross
		validation and subsampling is supported through OpenMP. The
		Armadillo C++ library is used as the primary linear algebra
		engine. Armadillo is licensed under the MPL 2.0. The Armadillo
		C++ library is primarily developed at NICTA (Australia) by
		Conrad Sanderson, with contributions from around the world.
		Furthermore the package utilize various Boost libraries, in
		particular the Tuple library by Jaakko Jarvi and the Random
		library by Jens Maurer. The Boost libraries are licensed under
		the Boost Software License.
