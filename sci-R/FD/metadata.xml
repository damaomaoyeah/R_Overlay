		Measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits, and
		other tools for functional ecology // FD is a package to
		compute different multidimensional FD indices. It implements a
		distance-based framework to measure FD that allows any number
		and type of functional traits, and can also consider species
		relative abundances. It also contains other useful tools for
		functional ecology.
