		Tree-based learning of varying coefficients in ordinal 2-stage
		linear mixed models // The package aims at learning varying
		fixed coefficients in ordinal 2-stage linear mixed models
		(OLMM) based on model-based recursive partitioning. The package
		includes a fitting function for OLMMs and a partitioning
		algorithm for varying fixed effects in OLMMs.
