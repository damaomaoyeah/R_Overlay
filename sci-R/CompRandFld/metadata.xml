		Composite-Likelihood Based Analysis of Random Fields // A set of
		procedures for the analysis of Random Fields using likelihood
		and non-standard likelihood methods is provided. Spatial
		analysis often involves dealing with large dataset. Therefore
		even simple studies may be too computationally demanding.
		Composite likelihood inference is emerging as a useful tool for
		mitigating such computational problems. This methodology shows
		satisfactory results when compared with other techniques such
		as the tapering method. Moreover, composite likelihood (and
		related quantities) have some useful properties similar to
		those of the standard likelihood.
