		Model collection for the simecol package // simecolModels is an
		open collection of (mostly published) models implemented in the
		object oriented "simecol" style. The models are intended for
		reproducing and extending published work and for teaching
		purposes. The package is growing work in progress which may be
		eventually splitted in several thematic branches.
