		Lattice Options and Add-ins (loa) // Various plots and functions
		that make use of the lattice/trellis plotting framework. The
		plots (which include loaPlot, GoogleMap and trianglePlot) use
		panelPal, a function that extends lattice and hexbin package
		methods to automate plot subscripting and panel-to-panel and
		panel-to-key synchronization/management. See ?loa for further
		details.
