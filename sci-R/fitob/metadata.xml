		General solvers for the general Black-Scholes (Fokker Planck)
		partial differential equation (PDE) in a multi-dimensional
		setting with main application in finance (option pricing). //
		The main focus in this package is the solving of the Black-
		Scholes (Fokker Planck) PDE for financial contract pricing. It
		offers a general script languages that describes any financial
		contract in an efficient and unique way. These financial
		pricing problems can be in multi-dimensions, for which we
		employ sparse grids with the combination technique. These
		initial value parabolic problems require an efficient linear
		solver, for which we developed a geometrical multigrid solver.
		We tested this fitob package up to 12 dimensions, where
		reasonable results were achieved only up to 5-8 dimensions
		(accuracy is problem dependent). Solving such convection-
		diffusion PDE in multi-dimensional setting could be beneficiary
		in other applications (other than finance) as well.
