		Exploring Genomic Relations at the Gene and SNP Level Through
		Enrichment, Similarity and Network Analysis // The central goal
		of XGR is to provide a data interpretation system. It is
		designed to make a user-defined gene or SNP list more
		interpretable by comprehensively utilising ontology and network
		information to reveal relationships and enhance opportunities
		for biological discovery. XGR is unique in supporting a broad
		range of ontologies (including knowledge of biological and
		molecular functions, pathways, diseases and phenotypes - in
		both human and mouse) and different types of networks
		(including functional, physical and pathway interactions).
		There are two core functionalities of XGR. The first is to
		provide basic infrastructures for easy access to built-in
		ontologies and networks. The second is to support data
		interpretations via 1) enrichment analysis using either built-
		in or custom ontologies, 2) similarity analysis for calculating
		semantic similarity between genes (or SNPs) based on their
		ontology annotation profiles, and 3) network analysis for
		identification of gene networks given a query list of
		(significant) genes or SNPs. Together with its web app, XGR
		aims to provide a user-friendly tool for exploring genomic
		relations at the gene and SNP level.
