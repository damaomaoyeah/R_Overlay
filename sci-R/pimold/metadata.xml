		Probabilistic Index Models // Fit a probabilistic index model.
		This package is the original one described in the dissertation
		of prof. dr. Jan De Neve and the paper by De Neve and Thas
		(2015): A regression framework for rank tests based on the
		probabilistic index model, JASA 511, 1276-1283. Note that the
		complete pim package is reworked to have a more intuitive
		formula interface. This old version exists only for reference
		to those papers.
