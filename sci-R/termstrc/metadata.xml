		Zero-coupon Yield Curve Estimation // The package offers a wide
		range of functions for term structure estimation based on
		static and dynamic coupon bond and yield data sets. The
		implementation focuses on the cubic splines approach of
		McCulloch (1971, 1975) and the Nelson and Siegel (1987) method
		with extensions by Svensson (1994), Diebold and Li (2006) and
		De Pooter (2007). We propose a weighted constrained
		optimization procedure with analytical gradients and a globally
		optimal start parameter search algorithm. Extensive summary
		statistics and plots are provided to compare the results of the
		different estimation methods. Several demos are available using
		data from European government bonds and yields.
