		Dynamic Systems Estimation (Time Series Package) // Tools for
		multivariate, linear, time-invariant, time series models. This
		includes ARMA and state-space representations, and methods for
		converting between them. It also includes simulation methods
		and several estimation functions. The package has functions for
		looking at model roots, stability, and forecasts at different
		horizons. The ARMA model representation is general, so that
		VAR, VARX, ARIMA, ARMAX, ARIMAX can all be considered to be
		special cases. Kalman filter and smoother estimates can be
		obtained from the state space model, and state-space model
		reduction techniques are implemented. An introduction and
		User's Guide is available in a vignette.
