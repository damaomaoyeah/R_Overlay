		Unit Root Tests and Graphics for Seasonal Time Series // This
		package contains several functions for analysing quarterly and
		monthly time series. Unit root test: ADF, KPSS, HEGY, and CH,
		as well as graphics: Buys-Ballot and seasonal cycles, among
		others, have been implemented to accomplish either an
		analytical or a graphical analysis. Combined use of both
		enables the user to characterize the seasonality as
		deterministic, stochastic or a mixture of them. An easy to use
		graphical user interface is also provided to run some of the
		implemented functions.
