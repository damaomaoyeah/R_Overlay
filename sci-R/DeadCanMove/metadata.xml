		Assess how spatial roadkill patterns change with temporal
		sampling scheme // From a baseline data frame of dead
		individuals recorded daily at different road stretches,
		simulate varying sub-sampling schemes, calculate roadkill
		hotspots based on each scheme, and compare hotspot patterns
		between sampling schemes and the baseline data.
