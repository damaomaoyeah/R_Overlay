		MixCluster performs the cluster analysis, the semi-supervized and

		// MixCluster performs the cluster analysis of mixed-type data
		(data set composed by different natures of variables). More
		precisely, it can analyze data whose the variables are
		continuous, integer, binary or ordinal. MixCluster models the
		data distribution by a mixture model of Gaussian copulas
		(Marbac and al, 2014). Therefore, it takes into account the
		intra-class dependencies and the one-dimensional margins of its
		components follow classical distributions (Gaussian, Poisson or
		multinomial). The inference is performed by a Gibbs sampler
		implemented in MixCluster. Moreover, tool-functions are focused
		on the data visualization. They used the latent variables
		related to the Gaussian copulas in order to obtain a
		scatterplot of the individuals per class by using PCA-type
		visualization. This approach also permit to summarize the
		intra-class dependencies.
