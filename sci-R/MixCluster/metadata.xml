		MixCluster performs the clustering of mixed-type data sets (data
		sets with different natures of variables) with missing values.
		// MixCluster performs the cluster analysis of mixed-type data
		(data set composed by different natures of variables). More
		precisely, it can analyze data whose the variables are
		continuous, integer, binary or ordinal. MixCluster models the
		data distribution by a mixture model of Gaussian copulas
		(Marbac and al, 2015). Therefore, it takes the intra-class
		dependencies  into account and the one-dimensional margins of
		its components follow classical distributions (Gaussian,
		Poisson or multinomial). The inference is performed by a Gibbs
		sampler implemented in MixCluster. Moreover, tool-functions are
		focused on the data visualization. They used the latent
		variables related to the Gaussian copulas in order to obtain a
		scatterplot of the individuals per class by using PCA-type
		visualization. This approach also permit to summarize the
		intra-class dependencies.
