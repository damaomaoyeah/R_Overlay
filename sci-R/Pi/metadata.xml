		Leveraging Genetic Evidence to Prioritise Drug Targets at the
		Gene, Pathway and Network Level // Priority index or Pi is
		developed as a genomic-led target prioritisation approach, with
		the focus on leveraging genetic data to prioritise targets at
		the gene, pathway and network level. Based on evidence of
		genetic association from genome-wide association study (GWAS)
		data, this prioritisation system is able to identify likely
		modulated genes responsible for the observed disease
		association (seed genes) by utilising evidence including
		knowledge of linkage disequilibrium (co-inherited variants),
		genomic location (distance from the gene) and genetic
		association with gene expression for different disease relevant
		cell and tissue types and states. Seed genes are scored in an
		integrative way quantifying the genetic influence. Scored seed
		genes are subsequently used as baits to enable ranking of both
		seed genes and additional (non-seed) genes; this is achieved by
		iteratively exploring the global connectivity of a gene
		interaction network. Genes with the highest priority are
		further used to identify/prioritise pathways that are
		significantly enriched with highly prioritised genes.
		Prioritised genes are also used to identify gene networks
		interconnecting many highly prioritised genes with a minimal
		number of less prioritised genes as linkers.
