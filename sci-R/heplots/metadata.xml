		Visualizing Hypothesis Tests in Multivariate Linear Models //
		Provides HE plot functions for visualizing hypothesis tests in
		multivariate linear models. They represents sums-of-squares-
		and-products matrices for linear hypotheses and for error using
		ellipses (in two dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three
		dimensions).
