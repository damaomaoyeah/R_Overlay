		DepthProc // Data depth concept offers a variety of powerful and
		user friendly tools for robust exploration and inference for
		multivariate data. The offered techniques may be successfully
		used in cases of lack of our knowledge on parametric models
		generating data due to their nonparametric nature. The package
		consist of among others implementations of several data depth
		techniques involving multivariate quantile-quantile plots,
		multivariate scatter estimators, multivariate Wilcoxon tests
		and robust regressions.
