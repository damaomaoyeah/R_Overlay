		Distributed Storage and List // A package providing functions and
		methods for handling distributed storage (DStorage) and lists
		(DLlist). It implements an abstract DList class for storing
		large list-type objects in a distributed manner. In doing so it
		uses a well defined storage backend implemented based on the
		DStorage class. It allows for processing such DLists on
		distributed systems efficiently.
