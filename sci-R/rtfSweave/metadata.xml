		An Sweave Driver to Process Files with R Code and RTF Text // An
		Sweave driver that allows the user to use Sweave to create
		documents having R code chunks and rich text format (RTF)
		documentation chunks. After Sweave()ing the file the output is
		an .RTF file that can be opened in word processors like
		Microsoft Word. This approach may be useful for people who
		collaborate primarily with Word users but would otherwise
		prefer to use Sweave with LaTeX.
