		Generic Reproducible Parallel Backend for foreach Loops // This
		package provides functions to perform reproducible parallel
		foreach loops, using independent random streams as generated by
		L'Ecuyer's combined multiple-recursive generator [L'Ecuyer
		(1999)]. It enables to easily convert standard %dopar% loops
		into fully reproducible loops, independently of the number of
		workers, the task scheduling strategy, or the chosen parallel
		environment and associated foreach backend.
