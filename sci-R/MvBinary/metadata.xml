		Modelling Multivariate Binary Data with Blocks of Specific One-
		Factor Distribution // Modelling Multivariate Binary Data with
		Blocks of Specific One-Factor Distribution. Variables are
		grouped into independant blocks. Each variable is described by
		two continuous parameters (its marginal probability and its
		dependency strength with the other block variables), and one
		binary parameters (positive or negative dependency). Model
		selection consists in the estimation of the repatition of the
		vairables into blocks. It is carried out by the maximization of
		the BIC criterion by a deterministic (faster) algorithm or by a
		stochastic (more time consumming but optimal) algorithm. Tool
		functions facilitate the model interpretation.
