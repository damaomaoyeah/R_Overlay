		Dynamic Deterministic Effects Propagation Networks: Infer
		signalling networks for timecourse RPPA data. // DDEPN (Dynamic
		Deterministic Effects Propagation Networks): Infer signalling
		networks for timecourse data. Given a matrix of high-throughput
		genomic or proteomic timecourse data, generated after external
		perturbation of the biological system, DDEPN models the time-
		dependent propagation of active and passive states depending on
		a network structure. Optimal network structures given the
		experimental data are reconstructed. Two network inference
		algorithms can be used: inhibMCMC, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
		sampling approach and GA, a Genetic Algorithm network
		optimisation. Inclusion of prior biological knowledge can be
		done using different network prior models.
