		Accessing Csound functionality through R // Provides some basic
		access in an R session to Csound (http://www.csounds.com), a
		powerful free and open-source software synthesizer. The package
		functionality is largely geared towards supporting the needs of
		the playitbyr package and is not particularly mature on its
		own, but it certainly can be used without knowing anything
		about playitbyr.
