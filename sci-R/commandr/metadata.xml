		Command pattern in R // An S4 representation of the Command
		design pattern. The Operation class is a simple implementation
		using closures and supports forward and reverse (undo)
		evaluation. The more complicated Protocol framework represents
		each type of command (or analytical protocol) by a formal S4
		class. Commands may be grouped and consecutively executed using
		the Pipeline class. Example use cases include logging, do/undo,
		analysis pipelines, GUI actions, parallel processing, etc.
