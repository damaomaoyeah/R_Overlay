		Functions for generating restricted permutations of data // The
		'permute' package implements a set of restricted permutation
		designs for freely exchangeable, line transects (time series),
		and spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of
		samples). 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which
		the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-
		exchangeable or one of the restricted designs. The 'permute'
		package is modelled after the permutation schemes of Canoco 3.1
		(and later) by Cajo ter Braak.
