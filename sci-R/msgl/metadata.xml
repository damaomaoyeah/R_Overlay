		High dimensional multiclass classification using sparse group
		lasso // Sparse group lasso multiclass classification, suitable
		for high dimensional problems with many classes. Fast algorithm
		for solving the multinomial sparse group lasso convex
		optimization problem. This package apply template
		metaprogramming techniques, therefore -- when compiling the
		package from source -- a high level of optimization is needed
		to gain full speed (e.g. for the GCC compiler use -O3). Use of
		multiple processors for cross validation and subsampling is
		supported through OpenMP. The Armadillo C++ library is used as
		the primary linear algebra engine.
