		Generate PMML for various models // The Predictive Modelling
		Markup Language (PMML) is a language for representing models,
		in an application independent way. Such models can then be
		loaded into other applications supporting PMML, including ADAPA
		from Zementis, Teradata Warehouse Miner and IBM's DB2. The
		package provides a generic pmml function to generate pmml for
		an object. Using a S3 generic function the appropriate method
		for the class of the supplied object is dispatched. The package
		currently supports the export of PMML for linear regression,
		generalized linear regression, multinomial logistic regression,
		SVMs, rpart classification trees, randomSurvivalForest,
		randomForest, and kmeans clusters.
