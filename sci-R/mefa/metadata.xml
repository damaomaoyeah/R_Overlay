		Multivariate Data Handling in Ecology and Biogeography // A
		framework package aimed to provide standardized computational
		environment for specialist work via object classes to represent
		the data coded by samples, taxa and segments (i.e.
		subpopulations, repeated measures). It supports easy processing
		of the data along with cross tabulation and relational data
		tables for samples and taxa. An object of class `mefa' is a
		project specific compendium of the data and can be easily used
		in further analyses. Methods are provided for extraction,
		aggregation, conversion, plotting, summary and reporting of
		`mefa' objects. Reports can be generated in plain text or LaTeX
		format. Vignette contains worked examples.
