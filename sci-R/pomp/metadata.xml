		Statistical Inference for Partially Observed Markov Processes //
		Tools for working with partially observed Markov processes
		(POMPs, AKA stochastic dynamical systems, state-space models).
		'pomp' provides facilities for implementing POMP models,
		simulating them, and fitting them to time series data by a
		variety of frequentist and Bayesian methods.  It is also a
		platform for the implementation of new inference methods.
