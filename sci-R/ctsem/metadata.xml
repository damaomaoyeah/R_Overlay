		Continuous Time Structural Equation Modelling // ctsem is an R
		package for continuous time structural equation modelling.
		ctsem interfaces to the the OpenMx package (available from
		http://openmx.psyc.virginia.edu/), and provides an easily
		accessible dynamic modelling approach for panel and time series
		data.  Most dynamic modelling approaches to longitudinal data
		rely on the assumption that time intervals between observations
		are consistent.  When this assumption is adhered to, the data
		gathering process is necessarily limited to a specific
		schedule, and when broken, the resulting parameter estimates
		may be biased and reduced in power.  Continuous time models are
		conceptually similar to vector autoregressive models (thus also
		the latent change models popularised in a structural equation
		modelling context), however by explicitly including the length
		of time between observations, continuous time models are freed
		from the assumption that measurement intervals are consistent.
		This allows: data to be gathered irregularly; the elimination
		of noise and bias due to varying measurement intervals. The
		application of such a model in an SEM framework allows full-
		information maximum-likelihood estimates for both N = 1 and N
		1 cases, multiple measured indicators per latent process, and
		the flexibility to incorporate additional elements, including
		individual heterogeneity in the latent process and manifest
		intercepts, and time dependent and independent exogenous
		covariates. Furthermore, due to the SEM implementation we are
		able to estimate a random effects model where the impact of
		time dependent and time independent predictors can be assessed
		simultaneously, but without the classic problems of random
		effects models assuming no covariance between unit level
		effects and predictors.  The flexibility of ctsem may also of
		course be applicable for modelling of datasets where the
		observations are regularly spaced.
