		OmniLog(R) Phenotype Microarray Example Data // Tools for
		analysing OmniLog(R) Phenotype Microarray (PM) data as produced
		by the device distributed by BIOLOG Inc. and similar kinds of
		data such as growth curves are provided in the opm package. The
		opmdata package contains the entire example data set from Vaas
		et al. (2012), which has been removed from opm due to its size,
		as well as the data sets from Wittmann et al. (2013) and
