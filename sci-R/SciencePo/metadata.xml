		Political Behaviour Analysis Tool // SciencePo is a facility
		package that makes the using of R in political science even
		more intuitive. The very objective for the SciencePo is to
		cover standard descriptive analyses for experimental data.
		Later updates will focus on cutting-edge implementations
		published in the relevant journals of the field.
