		Generalized Semi-Linear Canonical Correlation Analysis // This is
		a package for Generalized Semi-linear Canonical Correlation
		Analysis (GSLCCA, described in Brain et al, 2011).  GSLCCA
		estimates the parameters of a given nonlinear model to maximize
		the correlation with a linear combination of multiple response
		variables. This method was developed to characterize EEG power
		spectra under different treatment regimens in research and
		development projects at Pfizer.
