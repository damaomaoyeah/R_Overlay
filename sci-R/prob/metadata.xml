		Elementary Probability on Finite Sample Spaces // This package
		provides a framework for performing elementary probability
		calculations on finite sample spaces, which may be represented
		by data frames or lists.  Functionality includes setting up
		sample spaces, counting tools, defining probability spaces,
		performing set algebra, calculating probability and conditional
		probability, tools for simulation and checking the law of large
		numbers, adding random variables, and finding marginal
		distributions. Characteristic functions for all base R
		distributions are included.
