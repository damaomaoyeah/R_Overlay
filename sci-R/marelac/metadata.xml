		Tools for Aquatic Sciences // Datasets, constants, conversion
		factors, utilities for MArine, Riverine, Estuarine, LAcustrine
		and Coastal science. The package contains among others: (1)
		chemical and physical constants and datasets, e.g. atomic
		weights, gas constants, the earths bathymetry; (2) conversion
		factors (e.g. gram to mol to liter, barometric units,
		temperature, salinity); (3) physical functions, e.g. to
		estimate concentrations of conservative substances, gas
		transfer and diffusion coefficients, the Coriolis force and
		gravity; (4) thermophysical properties of the seawater, as from
		the UNESCO polynomial or from the more recent derivation based
		on a Gibbs function.
