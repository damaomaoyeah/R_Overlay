		Bayesian clustering using spike-and-slab hierarchical model,
		suitable for clustering high-dimensional data. // The package
		builds a dendrogram with log posterior as a natural distance
		defined by the model. It is also capable to computing Bayesian
		discrimination probabilities equivalent to the implemented
		Bayesian clustering. Spike-and-Slab models are adopted in a way
		to be able to produce an importance measure for clustering and
		discriminant variables. The method works properly for data with
		small sample size and high dimensions. The model parameter
		estimation maybe difficult, depending on data structure and the
		chosen distribution family.
