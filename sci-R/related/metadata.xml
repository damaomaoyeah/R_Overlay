		related: an R package for analyzing pairwise relatedness data
		based on codominant molecular markers // Provides functions for
		calculating relatedness from codominant genetic data using any
		or all of seven estimators, and includes options for
		considering inbreeding and genotyping errors, and can estimate
		95% confidence intervals.  Also includes simulation options for
		comparing the performance of different estimators on a given
		data set and estimating the expected resolution given a
		particular data set.
