		Influence Measures and Diagnostic Plots for Multivariate Linear
		Models // Computes regression deletion diagnostics for
		multivariate linear models and provides some associated
		diagnostic plots.  The diagnostic measures include hat-values
		(leverages), generalized Cook's distance, and generalized
		squared 'studentized' residuals.  Several types of plots to
		detect influential observations are provided.
