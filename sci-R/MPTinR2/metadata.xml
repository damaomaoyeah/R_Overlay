		Analyze Multinomial Processing Tree Models // This is a
		completely new version of a package for the analysis of
		multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (e.g.,  Riefer, D. M.,
		and Batchelder, W. H. [1988]. Multinomial modeling and the
		measurement of cognitive processes. Psychological Review, 95,
		318-339) for individual and multi-individual data. This version
		is based on formal S4 classes and methods and contains a EM
		fitting algorithm written in Fortran. However, this version is
		still under heavy development, but the fitting is already
		functional and a lot faster. See ?fit.mpt and ?make.mpt for
		more details.
