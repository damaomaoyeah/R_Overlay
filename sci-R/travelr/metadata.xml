		Functions for Travel Demand Modeling // Provides a suite of
		functions for building travel demand models, with C/C++
		support. Includes fast routines for common operations that are
		specific to travel demand modeling including gravity model,
		iterative proportional fitting (Fratar/Furness), network path
		building, and highway assignment (several common and
		contemporary equilibrium assignment algorithms are
		implemented).
