		'functions for the routine handling and analysis of data
		collected by portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) and
		other similar mobile monitoring systems' 'Functions for the
		Routine Handling and Analysis of Data Collected by Portable
		Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) and Other Similar Mobile
		Monitoring Systems' // The R package pems.utils contains
		functions for the routine handling and analysis of data from
		portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) and other similar
		mobile monitoring systems. The current version, pems.utils 0.2,
		includes functions for data reading and importing, data
		cleanup, reformatting, alignment and merging, data
		visualization, screening and inspection, conditioning and sub-
		sampling, summary statistics calculation and analysis, and
		batch-wise analysis. The package also uses a dedicated 'pems'
		data class that manages many of the quality control, unit
		handling and data archiving issues that can sometimes hinder
		efforts to standardize PEMS research.
