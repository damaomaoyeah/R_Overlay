		Access Data Tables in a SQLite Data Base as Pseudo-Dataframes //
		This package contains functions that allow the user to treat
		data tables in a SQLite-accessible data base as if they were
		data frames, including the ability to access subsets of the
		rows and columns of the table; row "subscripts" can be
		specified as SQL queries.
