		Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) Tools for Time Series Analysis
		// Contains some implementations of Singular Spectrum Analysis
		(SSA) for the gapfilling and spectral decomposition of time
		series. It contains the code used by Buttlar et. al. (2014),
		Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics. In addition, the iterative
		SSA gapfilling method of Kondrashov and Ghil (2006) is
		implemented. All SSA calculations are done via the truncated
		and fast SSA algorithm of Korobeynikov (2010) (package 'Rssa').
