		Grho parameters for asymptotic regression // The asymptotic
		regression model is often used in the analysis of NDF digestion
		data but the usual parameters are very highly correlated.  This
		package uses an alternative set of parameters -- the expected
		responses at 24, 36 and 48 hours - that are more stable.  For
		reasons we have now forgotten we called these Grho.
