		Diagnostic and prognostic meta-analysis (metamisc) // This
		package provides functions for diagnostic and prognostic
		research. It allows to perform meta-analysis of univariate
		(e.g. added value of a prognostic marker), bivariate (e.g.
		diagnostic test accuracy) and multivariate (e.g. previously
		published prediction model) statistics. Functionalities to
		update and externally validate prediction models are also
		implemented.
