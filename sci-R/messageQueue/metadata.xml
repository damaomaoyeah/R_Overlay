		Allow R to communicate with message queues // This package
		creates a simple way to interact with message queues regardless
		of the underlying provider of the queue (activeMQ or rabbitMQ).
		The idea is to provide this basic functionality such that R
		doesn't need to deal with the specifics of queues or their
		underlying implementation differences.  Provides a simple way
		to PUT a text message on a queue and GET a text message from a
		queue.
