		Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System // This project
		provides a group of new functions to calculate the outputs of
		the two main components of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger
		Rating System (CFFDRS) at various time scales (e.g. daily and
		hourly): the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and the Fire
		Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System. A few of the functions have
		two versions, the spreadsheet- and raster- based.
