		CENTIPEDE learns a DNaseI footprint of a transcription factor and
		predicts its binding sites // Centipede fits a bayesian
		hierarchical mixture model to learn TF-specific distribution of
		experimental data on a particular cell-type for a set of
		candidate binding sites described by a motif. More
		documentation is under preparation and will be make available
		soon at http://centipede.uchicago.edu
