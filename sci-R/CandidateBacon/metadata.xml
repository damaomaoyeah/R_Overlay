		Provides a measure of the average connectedness among as set of
		candidate genes and a network-specific distribution of the
		connectedness of random gene pairs for an arbitrary network of
		pair wise interactions. // Selection of candidate genes is an
		important step in the exploration of complex genetic
		architecture. However, it can cause misleading results if not
		validated properly. The CandidateBacon package is a simple tool
		that provides such validation and ensures that proposed
		interaction networks are not statistical artifacts.
