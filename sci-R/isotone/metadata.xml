		Active set and generalized PAVA for isotone optimization //
		Contains two main functions: gpava() for solving general
		isotone regression problem using the pool-adjacent-violators
		algorithm (PAVA). activeSet() provides a framework of active
		set methods for isotone optimization problems with arbitrary
		order restrictions. Various types of loss functions are pre-
		specified.
