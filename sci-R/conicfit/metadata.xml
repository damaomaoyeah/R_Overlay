		Algorithms for Fitting Circles, Ellipses and Conics Based on the
		Work by Prof. Nikolai Chernov // Geometric circle fitting with
		Levenberg-Marquardt (a, b, R), Levenberg-Marquardt reduced (a,
		b), Landau, Spath and Chernov-Lesort. Algebraic circle fitting
		with Taubin, Kasa, Pratt and Fitzgibbon-Pilu-Fisher. Geometric
		ellipse fitting with ellipse LMG (geometric parameters) and
		conic LMA (algebraic parameters). Algebraic ellipse fitting
		with Fitzgibbon-Pilu-Fisher and Taubin.
