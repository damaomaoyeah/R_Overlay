		An R interface to the Organon and Cipsanon models // CIPS-R was
		developed by Nathaniel Osborne, Doug Maguire and David Hann at
		the Center for Intensive Planted-forest Silviculture (CIPS).
		CIPS is a research institute at Oregon State University in
		Corvallis, Oregon. This package provides an interface to the
		Organon and Cipsanon forest growth, yield and wood quality
		models.  These models allow users to empirically simulate the
		development of forests, of many species given various
		silvicultural regimes.  Both models simulate forest development
		at the resolution of spatially implicit, individual trees.
		Currently, CIPS-R cannot be distributed publicly. The use of
		CIPS-R is limited to members of the CIPS cooperative.
