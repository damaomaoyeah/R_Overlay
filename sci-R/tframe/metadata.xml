		Time Frame Coding Kernel // A kernel of functions for programming
		time series methods in a way that is relatively independently
		of the representation of time. Also provides plotting, time
		windowing, and some other utility functions which are
		specifically intended for time series. See the Guide
		distributed as a vignette, or '?tframe.Intro' for more details.
		(User utilities are in package 'tfplot'.)
