		Routines for Fitting Kinetic Models to Chemical Degradation Data
		// The FOCUS Kinetics Report first published in 2006 describes
		mathematical models and recommends statistical methods for the
		evaluation of chemical degradation data. This package
		implements fitting the kinetic models suitable for observations
		of the decline of a single chemical compound (no metabolite
		formation/decline or multi-compartment kinetics). Please note
		that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or
		fitness for a particular purpose.  'kinfit' is maintained, but
		not actively developed at the moment. Please check the 'mkin'
		package for an actively developed package for kinetic
		evaluations of degradation data.
