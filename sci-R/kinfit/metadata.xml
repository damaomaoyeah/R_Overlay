		Routines for fitting kinetic models to chemical degradation data
		// 'kinfit' provides simple calculation routines based on the
		FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006). Only kinetic models for parent
		only datasets are included (no metabolite formation/decline or
		multicompartment kinetics). Please note that no warranty is
		implied for correctness of results or fitness for a particular
		purpose. This package is maintained, but not actively developed
		at the moment. Please check the mkin package for an actively
		developed package for kinetic evaluations of degradation data.
