		Routines for fitting kinetic models to chemical degradation data
		// Simple calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics
		Report (2006). Only kinetic models for parent only datasets are
		included (no metabolite formation/decline or multicompartment
		kinetics). Please note that no warranty is implied for
		correctness of results or fitness for a particular purpose.
		This package is not actively developed at the moment. Please
		check the mkin package for an actively maintained package for
		kinetic evaluations of degradation data
