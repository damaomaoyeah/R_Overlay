		Raw-Means Plots for Experimental Designs // raw.means.plot is a
		function for visualizing results of experimental designs with
		up to two factors (i.e., conditions). The main feature is that
		it plots both the raw data in the background and superimposed
		the means to provide a better and more accurate visualization
		of the underlying distribution. To distinguish between factor
		levels which would be at the same x-axis position in classical
		plots, each factor level is offseted from the other factor
		levels. For datasets with more than two factors raw.means.plot2
		can aggregate the data prior to plotting.
