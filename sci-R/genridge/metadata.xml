		Generalized Ridge Trace Plots for Ridge Regression // The
		genridge package introduces generalizations of the standard
		univariate ridge trace plot used in ridge regression and
		related methods.  These graphical methods show both bias
		(actually, shrinkage) and precision, by plotting the covariance
		ellipsoids of the estimated coefficients, rather than just the
		estimates themselves.  2D and 3D plotting methods are provided,
		both in the space of the predictor variables and in the
		transformed space of the PCA/SVD of the predictors.
