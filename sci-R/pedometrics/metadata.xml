		Pedometric Tools and Techniques // This package contains
		functions to employ many tools and techniques used in the field
		of pedometrics (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedometrics
		for definition of pedometrics). These functions were developed
		to fulfil the demands created by the PhD research project
		(2012-2016) entitled Contribution to the Construction of Models
		for Predicting Soil Properties, developed by Alessandro Samuel-
		Rosa under the supervision of Dr Lucia HC Anjos (Universidade
		Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Dr Gustavo M Vasques
		(Embrapa Solos, Brazil), and Dr Gerard BM Heuvelink (ISRIC -
		World Soil Information, the Netherlands). The project is
		supported by the CAPES, Ministrio da Educao, Braslia - DF
		70040-020, Brazil, process ID BEX 11677/13-9. Several functions
		are simple wrapper functions that extend the functionalities of
		other functions commonly used for the analysis of pedometric
		data. It should be noted that changes are likely to occur quite
		often and using this package as a dependency for other packages
		is strongly discouraged.
