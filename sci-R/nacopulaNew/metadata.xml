		Nested Archimedean Copulas // An R package for working with
		nested Archimedean copulas. Specifically, providing procedures
		for computing function values and cube volumes, characteristics
		such as Kendall's tau and tail dependence coefficients,
		efficient sampling algorithms, various estimators, and
		goodness-of-fit tests. The package also contains related
		univariate distributions and special functions such as the
		Sibuya distribution, the polylogarithm, Stirling and Eulerian
		numbers.
