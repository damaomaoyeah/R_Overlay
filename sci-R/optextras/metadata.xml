		A set of tools to support optimization methods (function
		minimization with at most bounds and masks). // Tools to assist
		in safely applying user generated objective and derivative
		function to optimization programs. These are primarily function
		minimization methods with at most bounds and masks on the
		parameters. Provides a way to check the basic computation of
		objective functions that the user provides, along with proposed
		gradient and Hessian functions, as well as to wrap such
		functions to avoid failures when inadmissible parameters are
		provided. Check bounds and masks. Check scaling or optimality
		conditions. Perform an axial search to seek lower points on the
		objective function surface. Includes forward, central and
		backward gradient approximation codes.
