		R-script suite for automated processing of proteomic peptide
		lists // cRacker has been programmed to automate standard
		normalization strategies of quantitative proteomic experiments.
		It simplifies the analysis of quantified peptide lists coming
		from various proteomic quantitation softwares. The applied
		normalization strategies are optimized for label free analyses
		of peptide intensities but also experiments using labeling
		approaches can be analyzed.
