		R Graphics Output in LaTeX Format // The tikzDevice package
		provides a graphics output device for R that records plots in a
		LaTeX-friendly format. The device transforms plotting commands
		issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks. When included in
		a paper typeset by LaTeX, these blocks are interpreted with the
		help of TikZ---a graphics package for TeX and friends written
		by Till Tantau. Using the tikzDevice, the text of R plots can
		contain LaTeX commands such as mathematical formula. The device
		also allows arbitrary LaTeX code to be inserted into the output
		stream.
