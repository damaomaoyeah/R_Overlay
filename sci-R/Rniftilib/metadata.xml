		R Interface to nifticlib for Reading and Writing Images in
		NIfTI-1 and ANALYZE Format // Provides functions to read/write
		images in ANALYZE(TM)7.5 (.img/.hdr) and NIfTI-1 (.nii) data
		format. The supported image formats are very common for
		functional brain MRI data analysis, but are also used for other
		tormographic or volumetric measurement data such as medical
		images of other body parts. The functions are implemented using
		the C-based nifticlib, a reference implementation for the NIfTI
		data format. Currently, this package embeds some slightly
		modified parts of the public domain library nifticlib-2.0.0
		(http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftilib/). The small
		modifications to the included nifticlib sources were required
		to comply with the R extensions rules.
