		Analyze Multinomial Processing Tree Models // Provides a user-
		friendly way for the analysis of multinomial processing tree
		(MPT) models (e.g.,  Riefer, D. M., and Batchelder, W. H.
		[1988]. Multinomial modeling and the measurement of cognitive
		processes. Psychological Review, 95, 318-339) for single and
		multiple datasets. The main functions perform model fitting and
		model selection. Model selection can be done using AIC, BIC, or
		the Fisher Information Approximation (FIA) a measure based on
		the Minimum Description Length (MDL) framework. The model and
		restrictions can be specified in external files or within an R
		script in an intuitive syntax or using the context-free
		language for MPTs. The 'classical' .EQN file format for model
		files is also supported. Besides MPTs, MPTinR can fit a wide
		variety of other cognitive models such as SDT models (see
		fit.model). MPTinR supports multicore fitting and FIA
		calculation using the snowfall package. MPTinR can generate
		data from a model for e.g., simulation or parametric bootstrap
		and plot predicted versus observed data.
