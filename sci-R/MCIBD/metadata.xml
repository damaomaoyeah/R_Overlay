		Monte Carlo Identity-By-Descent Matrix Estimation // This is a
		package implemented for flexible identity-by-descent (IBD)
		matrix estimation in F2 pedigrees. The IBD matrix estimate is
		approached by a Monte Carlo strategy, where the segregation of
		founder alleles is easy to define. Epistatic IBD matrices can
		also be calculated for two arbitrary loci. Such IBD matrix
		estimates are typically used in variance component quantitative
		trait loci (QTL) analysis. Parallelization is implemented to
		enhance the performance of Monte Carlo sampling.
