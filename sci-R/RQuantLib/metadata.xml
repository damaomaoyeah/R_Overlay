		R interface to the QuantLib library // The RQuantLib package
		makes parts of QuantLib visible to the R user. Currently a
		number option pricing functions are included, both vanilla and
		exotic, as well as a broad range of fixed-income functions.
		Also included are general calendaring and holiday utilities.
		Further software contributions are welcome. . The QuantLib
		project aims to provide a comprehensive software framework for
		quantitative finance. The goal is to provide a standard open
		source library for quantitative analysis, modeling, trading,
		and risk management of financial assets. . The Windows binary
		version is self-contained and does not require a QuantLib (or
		Boost) installation. . RQuantLib uses the Rcpp R/C++ interface
		class library. See the Rcpp package on CRAN (or R-Forge) for
		more information on Rcpp. . Note that while RQuantLib's code is
		licensed under the GPL (v2 or later), QuantLib itself is
		released under a somewhat less restrictive Open Source license
		(see QuantLib-License.txt).
