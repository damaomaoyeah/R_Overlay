		Biodiversity Analyses in a Paleontological and Phylogenetic
		Context // Contains a suite of functions to analyze how
		speciation, extinction  character change contribute to
		biodiversity and display these relationships graphically.  The
		functions are designed to inform realistic models of clade
		evolution; examples are drawn from data on planktonic
		foraminifera or generated randomly.  Development is ongoing;
		paleoPhylo currently consists of graphical tools to plot
		paleobiological phylogenies incorporating stratigraphic
		uncertainty.
