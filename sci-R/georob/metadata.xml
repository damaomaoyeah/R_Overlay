		Robust Geostatistical Analysis of Spatial Data // The georob
		package provides functions for fitting linear models with
		spatially correlated errors by robust and Gaussian Restricted
		Maximum Likelihood and for computing robust and customary point
		and block kriging predictions, along with utility functions for
		cross-validation and for unbiased back-transformation of
		kriging predictions of log-transformed data.
