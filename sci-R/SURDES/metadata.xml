		Functions for a stratified SURvey DESign // A stratified survey
		design method that selects sampling points in a given territory
		using environmental and spatial distances as surrogates of
		overall diversity. The procedure minimises the variation
		uncovered by the selected points using a set of consecutive
		criteria repeated iteratively. In each iteration, a p-median
		allocation criterion is used to define a vector of preselected
		sites, then a set of user defined conditions is applied to
		restrict the preselected sites so that one location is selected
		in each iteration.
