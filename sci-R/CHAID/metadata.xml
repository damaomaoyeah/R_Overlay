		CHi-squared Automated Interaction Detection // This package
		offers an implementation of CHAID, a type of decision tree
		technique for a nominal scaled dependent variable published in
		1980 by Gordon V. Kass. CHAID stands for Chi-squared Automated
		Interaction Detection and detects interactions between
		categorized variables of a data set, one of which is the
		dependent variable. The remaining variables may or may not be
		ordered. An algorithm for recursive partitioning is
		implemented, based on maximizing the significance of a chi-
		squared statistic for cross-tabulations between the dependent
		variable and the predictors at each partition. The data are
		partitioned into mutually exclusive, exhaustive subsets that
		best describe the dependent variable. Multiway splits are used
		by default.
