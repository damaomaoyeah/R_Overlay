		Multi-Patient Analysis of Genomic Markers // Preprocess and
		analysis of genomic data. MPAgenomics provides wrappers from
		commonly used packages to streamline their repeated
		manipulation, offering an easy-to-use pipeline. The
		segmentation of successive multiple profiles is performed with
		an automatic choice of parameters involved in the wrapped
		packages. Considering multiple profiles in the same time,
		MPAgenomics wraps efficient penalized regression methods to
		select relevant markers associated with a given outcome.
