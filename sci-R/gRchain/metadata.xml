		Fitting Chain Graph Models // Fits (block recursive) chain graph
		models. The package contains various functions, wrappers,
		methods and classes for fitting, plotting and displaying
		different chain graph models. Currently the Cox Wermuth (1996)
		strategy is implemented based on the description in Caputo et
		al. (1997) together with some liberal interpretations of
		details by the package authors. Traceable regressions will
		follow.
