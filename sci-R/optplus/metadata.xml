		A wrapper for optimization methods (function minimization with at
		most bounds and masks). // A wrapper for running many
		optimization tools. These are primarily function minimization
		methods with at most bounds and masks on the parameters. By
		calls to optextras, provides a way to check the basic
		computation of objective functions that the user provides,
		along with proposed gradient and Hessian functions, as well as
		to wrap such functions to avoid failures when inadmissible
		parameters are provided. Check bounds and masks. Check scaling
		or optimality conditions. Perform an axial search to seek lower
		points on the objective function surface. Includes forward,
		central and backward gradient approximation codes.
