		DNET: dynamic networks via an integrative analysis of biological
		networks and high-throughput digitised data // The 'dnet'
		package is initiated to fill in the need of an open-source tool
		for analysing biological networks and high-throughput
		biological data in an integrative manner. More specifically,
		dnet intends to analyse the biological network whose
		nodes/genes are associated with digitised information such as
		expression levels across samples. Also, dnet aims to deliver an
		eye-intuitive tool for network-based sample stratifications.
