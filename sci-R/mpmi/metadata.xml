		Mixed-pair mutual information estimators // Uses a kernel
		smoothing approach to calculate Mutual Information for
		comparisons between all types of variables including continuous
		vs continuous, continuous vs discrete and discrete vs discrete.
		Uses a nonparametric bias correction giving Bias Corrected
		Mutual Information (BCMI). Implemented efficiently in Fortran
		95 with OpenMP and suited to large genomic datasets.
