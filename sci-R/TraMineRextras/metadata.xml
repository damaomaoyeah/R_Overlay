		TraMineR Extension // Collection of ancillary functions and
		utilities to be used in conjunction with the TraMineR package
		for sequence data exploration. Most of the functions are in
		test phase, lack systematic consistency check of the arguments
		and are subject to changes. Once fully checked, some of the
		functions of this collection could be included in a next
		release of TraMineR.
