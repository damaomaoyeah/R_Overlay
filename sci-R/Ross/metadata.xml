		Ross Ordering // To control order effects in questionnaires
		containing paired   comparisons, Ross (1934) described an
		optimal ordering of the pairings. The functions in this package
		construct the optimally   spaced, balanced ordering of
		pairings. They can also create subsets of the pairs for either
		a matrix-sampling design or a fully         incomplete design.
