		Genome Alteration Detection Algorithm (GADA) // The package
		implements a flexible and efficient analysis pipeline to detect
		genomic copy number alterations from microarray data. It can
		import the raw copy number normalized intensities provided by
		Illumina BeadStudio, Affymetrix powertools, or any similar
		format. Probes of different samples are split into separate
		files and can be analyzed on a standalone workstation or in
		parallel using a cluster/multicore computer. The speed and
		accuracy of the genome alteration detection analysis (GADA)
		approach combined with parallel computing results in one of the
		fastest and most accurate methods, and it is especially
		suitable to extract copy number alterations (CNAs) on
		genomewide studies involving hundreds of samples utilizing high
		density arrays with millions of markers. Functions to perform
		multivariate analysis and determining common regions among
		individuals are implemented. Functions to assess association
		between CNVs blocks and disease is also provided. Useful tools
		for the summarization and visualization of the discovered CNA
		are also included.
