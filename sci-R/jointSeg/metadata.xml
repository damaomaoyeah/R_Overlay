		Joint segmentation of multivariate (copy number) signals // This
		package implements functions to quickly segment multivariate
		signals into piecewise constant profiles.  It also implements a
		framework to generate realistic copy-number profiles.  A
		typical application is the joint segmentation of total DNA copy
		numbers and allelic ratios obtained from Single Nucleotide
		Polymorphism (SNP) microarrays in cancer studies.
