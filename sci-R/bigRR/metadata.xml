		Generalized Ridge Regression (with special advantage for p  n
		cases) // The package fits large-scale (generalized) ridge
		regression for various distributions of response. The shrinkage
		parameters (lambdas) can be pre-specified or estimated using an
		internal update routine (fitting a heteroscedastic effects
		model, or HEM). It gives possibility to shrink any subset of
		parameters in the model. It has special computational advantage
		for the cases when the number of shrinkage parameters exceeds
		the number of observations. For example, the package is very
		useful for fitting large-scale omics data, such as high-
		throughput genotype data (genomics), gene expression data
		(transcriptomics), metabolomics data, etc.
