		Model Based Clustering, Classification and Discriminant Analysis
		Using the Mixture of Generalized Hyperbolic Distributions //
		Carries out model-based clustering, classification and
		discriminant analysis using five different models. The models
		are all based on the  generalized hyperbolic distribution.The
		first model 'MGHD' is the classical mixture of generalized
		hyperbolic distributions. The 'MGHFA' is the mixture of
		generalized hyperbolic factor analyzers for high dimensional
		data sets. The 'MSGHD', mixture of  multiple scaled generalized
		hyperbolic distributions. The 'cMSGHD' is a 'MSGHD' with convex
		contour plots. The 'MCGHD', mixture of  coalesced generalized
		hyperbolic distributions is a new more flexible model.
