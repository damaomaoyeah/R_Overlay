		Probabilistic Index Models // Fit a probabilistic index model.
		This package is the latest version of the pim package, and will
		end up being pim 2.0. It's a beta currently under development.
		There's a pim fitting engine with rudimentary functionality,
		but don't expect any back-compatibility with the previous
		versions of pim.
