		Testing the additional predictive value of high-dimensional data
		// 'globalboosttest' implements a permutation-based testing
		procedure to globally test the (additional) predictive value of
		a large set of predictors given that a small set of predictors
		is already available. Currently, 'globalboosttest' supports
		binary outcomes (via logistic regression) and survival outcomes
		(via Cox regression). It is based on boosting regression as
		implemented in the package 'mboost'.
