		Automatic Tracing and Display of Changes to Row Count //
		Classifies a data.frame such that row deletions and additions
		are tracked.  A mechanism exists to give formal names to the
		row subsets that are coming or going.  These names are used to
		populate a directed graph giving an account of all the
		transactions contributing to the state of the data.frame.  The
		generic as.audited() has a method for keyed data.frames that
		creates an audited data.frame. Methods exist that track row
		count changes for the generics: Ops, !, ^, |, [, subset, head,
		tail, unique, cast, melt, aggregate, and merge. audit()
		extracts the transaction table from the audited object, while
		write.audit() and read.audit() control exchange with the file
		system. An audit method for as.igraph() creates a graph object
		that can be displayed with the corresponding plot method.  Use
		options(audit= ) to provide an extra level of classification.
		Use options(artifact=TRUE) and as.xlsx() to save dropped
		records to file.
