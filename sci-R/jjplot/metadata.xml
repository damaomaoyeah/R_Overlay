		The jjplot plotting library for making beautiful plots fast and
		simple. // jjplot is a plotting library inspired by ggplot2.
		jjplot is written in grid and while not yet as functional as
		ggplot2, jjplot can quickly and easily produce beautiful
		graphics including line graphs, scatter plots, bar graphs, and
		boxplots.  jjplot also makes it straightfoward to compute and
		overlay statistics and fits onto graphs, and to facet graphs by
		factor via subplots and automatic color scales.
