		Help to Fit of a Parametric Distribution to Non-Censored or
		Censored Data // Extends the fitdistr function (of the MASS
		package) with several functions to help the fit of a parametric
		distribution to non-censored or censored data. Censored data
		may contain left censored, right censored and interval censored
		values, with several lower and upper bounds. In addition to
		maximum likelihood estimation method the package provides
		moment matching, quantile matching and maximum goodness-of-fit
		estimation methods (available only for non-censored data).
