		Routines for Fitting Kinetic Models with One or More State
		Variables to Chemical Degradation Data // Calculation routines
		based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006). Includes a function
		for conveniently defining differential equation models, model
		solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical
		solvers and a choice of the optimisation methods made available
		by the 'FME' package. If a C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is
		installed, differential equation models are solved using
		compiled C functions. Please note that no warranty is implied
		for correctness of results or fitness for a particular purpose.
