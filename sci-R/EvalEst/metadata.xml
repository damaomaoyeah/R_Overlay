		Dynamic Systems Estimation - Extensions // EvalEst provides
		functions for evaluating (time series) model estimation
		methods. These facilitate monte carlo experiments of repeated
		simulations and estimations. The package also provides methods
		for looking at the distribution of the results from these
		experiments, including model roots (which are an equivalence
		class invariant).
