		Class Unions, Matrix Operations, and Color Schemes for OOMPA //
		The oompaBase package defines the class unions that must be
		preloaded in order for the basic tools in the OOMPA (object-
		oriented microarray and proteomics analysis) project to be
		defined and loaded. It also includes vectorized operations for
		row-by-row means, variances, and t-tests. Finally, it provides
		new color schemes.
