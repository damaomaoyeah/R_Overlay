		Bayesian model selection in logistic regression for the detection
		of adverse drug reactions // Spontaneous adverse event reports
		have a high potential for detecting adverse drug
		reactions.However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such
		databases requires statistical methods.The MHTrajectoryR
		package propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is
		viewed as a model selection challenge. Since the model space is
		huge, a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm carries out the model
		selection by maximizing the BIC criterion.
