		This packages allow users to ``background'' computations. //
		Perform calculations concurently in the background thereby
		freeing the R console to perform other tasks.  The package
		currently supports a sequential backend, where the calculation
		is evaluted when it is brought into the foreground along with a
		multicore backend, where the calculation is started immediately
		after it is backgrounded.  Other packages, such as
		multicore.background can be used for true process
		backgrounding.
