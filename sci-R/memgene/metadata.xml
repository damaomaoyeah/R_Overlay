		Spatial pattern detection in genetic distance data // MEMGENE
		software can detect relatively small reductions in the amount
		of gene flow across space.  By focusing on only the spatial
		component of genetic variation, MEMGENE has applications in
		landscape genetics where the movement and dispersal of
		organisms are studied using neutral genetic variation.
