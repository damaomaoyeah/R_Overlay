		Read big text files column by column, sometimes much bigger than
		available RAM, into R. // This package tries to solve the
		memory restrictions posed by large text files by breaking them
		into their columns first. These columns are later read
		individually into R. The package also provides some helper
		functions for manipulating the newly created objects.
