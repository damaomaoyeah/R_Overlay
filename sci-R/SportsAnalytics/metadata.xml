		Infrastructure for Sports Analytics // The aim of this package is
		to provide infrastructure for sports analysis. Anyway,
		currently it is a selection of data sets, functions to fetch
		sports data, examples, and demos -- with the ambition to
		develop bit by bit a set of classes to represent general
		concepts of sports analysis.
