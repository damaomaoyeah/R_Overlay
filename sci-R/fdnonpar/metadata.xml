		Methods for Multivariate or Functional Data // Nonparametric
		testing and visualization of samples consisting of vectors or
		arrays of observations x(t) taken at the same given measurement
		points t, such as functional data, time series or multivariate
		data (in the latter case, t is just an index). The independent
		variable may be multidimensional, but plotting is currently
		only possible for onedimensional arguments t (time series,
		functions of one variable). Comparison of group means of the
		data by a permutation tests (currently, the number of groups is
		limited to two). Pointwise rank based tests for goodness of
		fit.
