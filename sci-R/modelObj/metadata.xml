		A Model Object Framework for Regression Analysis // A utility
		library to facilitate the generalization of statistical methods
		built on a regression framework. Package developers can use
		'modelObj' methods to initiate a regression analysis without
		concern for the details of the regression model and the method
		to be used to obtain parameter estimates. The specifics of the
		regression step are left to the user to define when calling the
		function. The user of a function developed within the
		'modelObj' framework creates as input a 'modelObj' that
		contains the model and the R methods to be used to obtain
		parameter estimates and to obtain predictions.  In this way, a
		user can easily go from linear to non-linear models within the
		same package.
