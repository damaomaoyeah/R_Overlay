		R companion to "Curve and Surface Fitting with Splines" // This
		package provides a wrapper to the FITPACK routines written by
		Paul Dierckx. The original Fortran is available from
		http://www.netlib.org/dierckx 2012.02.15:  This package is
		broken. Currently, it seems NOT to have any users and is not
		worth fixing. These FITPACK routines are over 20 years old and
		may be obsolete. If you want to fix it, I will happily make you
		the maintainer. Spencer Graves
