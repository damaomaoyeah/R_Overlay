		Trend analysis on earth observation data // greenbrown is a
		collection of functions to analyse trends and trend changes in
		gridded time series like from satellite observations or climate
		model simulations. 'Greening' describes in the earth
		observation community positive trends in vegetation greenness.
		Vegetation greenness can be expressed as Normalized Difference
		Vegetation Index (NDVI) that is related to the coverage of
		green vegetation, photosynthetic activity and green biomass.
		Greening trends were observed worldwide based on satellite
		observations of the last 30 years (1980-2012). On the other
		hand, some regions have negative trends in vegetation greenness
		('browning'). The package 'greenbrown' provides access to
		different methods to analyze such greening and browning trends
		and trend changes in raster datasets like from satellite
		observations.
