		package is a companion to the textbook S. Weisberg (2014),
		"Applied Linear Regression," 4th edition, Wiley. It includes
		all the data sets discussed in the book and one function to
		access the textbook's website. This package depends on the car
		package.  Many data files in this package are included in the
		alr3 package as well, so only one of them should be loaded.
