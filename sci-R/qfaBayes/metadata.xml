		Tools for modelling the growth dynamics of arrays of large
		numbers of colonies and performing quantitative fitness
		analysis (QFA). // A set of tools and workflows for modelling
		the growth dynamics of colonies arrayed on plates, as well as
		performing quantitative fitness analysis (QFA) on distinct
		(usually genetically) types of colonies. Frequent colony growth
		observations are required in a specific R data.frame format.
		qfa can use image logs generated by Colonyzer
		(http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer/). You can pre-process
		these data with our Robot Object Database (ROD:
		http://sourceforge.net/projects/robotobjectdb/). The model is
		fit either using maximum likelihood (fast), or using a
		hierarchical Bayesian model for all of the colonies in an
		experimental unit (CPU intensive). The Bayesian fit is
		performed using Gibbs Sampling, implemented in C. With
		appropriately designed experiments, qfa can also estimate
		genetic interaction strengths and produce epistasis plots.
