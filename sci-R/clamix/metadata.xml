		Clustering modal multi valued symbolic data // Clamix implements
		two clustering methods for symbolic objects: the adapted
		leaders method and the adapted agglomerative hierarchical
		clustering Wards method. Both methods are compatible - they can
		be viewed as two approaches for solving the same clustering
		optimization problem. In the obtained clustering to each
		cluster is assigned its leader. The descriptions of the leaders
		offer simple interpretation of the clusters characteristics.
		The leaders method enables us to efficiently solve clustering
		problems with large number of units; while the agglomerative
		method is applied on the obtained leaders and enables us to
		decide upon the right number of clusters on the basis of the
		corresponding dendrogram.
