		A Flexible Modelling Environment for Inverse Modelling,
		Sensitivity, Identifiability, Monte Carlo Analysis. // Provides
		functions to help in fitting models to data, to perform Monte
		Carlo, sensitivity and identifiability analysis. It is intended
		to work with models be written as a set of differential
		equations that are solved either by an integration routine from
		package deSolve, or a steady-state solver from package
		rootSolve. However, the methods can also be used with other
		types of functions.
