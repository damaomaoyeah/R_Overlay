		Variance dispersion graphs and Fraction of design space plots for
		response surface designs // Uses a modification of the
		published FORTRAN code in "A Computer Program for Generating
		Variance Dispersion Graphs" by G. Vining, Journal of Quality
		Technology, Vol. 25 No. 1 January 1993, to produce variance
		dispersion graphs. Also produces fraction of design space
		plots, and contains data frames for several minimal run
		response surface designs.
