		Mixed Conditional Logit Models // This packages provides allows
		to estimate conditional logit models of binary responses and
		multinomial counts, with or without alternative-specific random
		effects (random intercepts only, no random slopes yet). The
		current implementation of the estimator for random effects
		variants of the model uses a Laplace approximation (or PQL)
		approach and thus should be used only if groups sizes are
		large.
