		Structural Equation Multidimensional Scaling // Fits a
		multidimensional scaling (MDS) model for three-way data. It
		integrates concepts from structural equation models (SEM) by
		assuming an underlying, latent dissimilarity matrix. The
		methods uses an alternating estimation procedure in which the
		unknown symmetric dissimilarity matrix is estimated in a SEM
		framework while the objects are represented in a low-
		dimensional space. As a special case it can also handle
		asymmetric input dissimilarities.
