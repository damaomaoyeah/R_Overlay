		Fuzzy similarity in species distributions // Functions to
		calculate fuzzy versions of species' occurrence patterns based
		on presence-absence data (including inverse distance
		interpolation, trend surface analysis and prevalence-
		independent favourability GLM), and pair-wise fuzzy similarity
		(based on fuzzy versions of commonly used similarity indices)
		among those occurrence patterns. Includes also functions for
		data preparation, such as obtaining unique abbreviations of
		species names, converting species lists (long format) to
		presence-absence tables (wide format), transposing part of a
		data frame, assessing the false discovery rate, or analysing
		multicollinearity among variables. Includes also sample
		datasets for providing practical examples.
