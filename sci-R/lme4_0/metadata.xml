		Linear mixed-effects models using S4 classes // Fit linear and
		generalized linear mixed-effects models. This is the
		implementation of lme4 available on CRAN and developed up to
		2011. It has been renamed to lme4.0, and is now deprecated in
		favor of the new lme4 package, for everything new. For
		reproducibility of past research and data analysis, lme4.0 is
		kept available.  For the time being, code and other packages
		who have made extensive use of the inner structure, e.g., of
		lmer() results, will have to depend on lme4.0 until their code
		can be adapted.
