		A R and Rcpp interface to the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister
		(SFMT) Random Number Generator provided by
		http://www.agner.org/random Randomc. // This package enables to
		use the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT) Random
		Number Generator provided by http://www.agner.org/random
		Randomc in R packages, in c++ code and in R code. This random
		generator is very fast and is very well suited to
		parallelization. It can also produces random number using
		parallelization that are identical to random bumbers produced
		in sequential code, leading to reproducible results.
