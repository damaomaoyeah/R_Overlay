		Analysis of Hidden Second-Order Stationary Point Processes //
		Hidden second-order stationarity is a generalization of second-
		order stationarity. This comprises a wide class of both
		homogeneous and inhomogeneous models. An addition to the
		spatstat package, this package contributes functions for the
		analysis of homogeneous and inhomogeneous spatial point
		patterns that have been proposed in the paper "Inhomogeneous
		spatial point processes with hidden second-order stationarity"
		by Ute Hahn and Eva B. Vedel Jensen (2013), where hidden secon-
		order stationarity is defined. By contrast to spatstat,
		sostatpp provides a unified approach to the different types of
		inhomogeneity. To this point it includes reweighted,
		retransformed and rescaled versions of Ripley's K-function and
		the L-function, the directional K function DeltaKdir,  and a
		framework for permutation tests. The package also supplies the
		data set scholtzia, which is not included in package spatstat.
		As of spatstat version 1.42, the permutation tests are now (in
		different form) also available in spatstat.
