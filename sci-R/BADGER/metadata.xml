		A package for identifying sample mixups in combined expression
		and genotyping studies. // BADGER takes a set of expression
		array data and one of genotype array data and, given
		information on how sample mappings were intended to be,
		determines the apparent relationships  between genotype and
		expression before predicting genotypes for each expression
		array. From these predictions, mismatches can be identified.
