		HIBAG -- HLA Genotype Imputation with Attribute Bagging // HIBAG
		is a state of the art software package for imputing HLA types
		using SNP data, and it uses the R statistical programming
		language. HIBAG can be used by researchers with published
		parameter estimates instead of requiring access to large
		training sample datasets. It combines the concepts of attribute
		bagging, an ensemble classifier method, with haplotype
		inference for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging is a
		technique which improves the accuracy and stability of
		classifier ensembles using bootstrap aggregating and random
		variable selection.
