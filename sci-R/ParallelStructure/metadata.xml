		function to run parallel jobs in STRUCTURE // MPI_structure" and
		"parallel_structure" are two R functions that calls STRUCTURE
		automatically for a set of predefined jobs. Jobs are
		distributed among all available computing units (cores or cpu)
		in order to make the best use of multi-core computer while
		running analysis of large data sets in STRUCTURE.
		MPI_structure" and "parallel_structure" have the same
		functionality and use the same set of parameters. MPI_structure
		relies on Rmpi package whereas parallel_structure relies on the
		"parallel" package.
