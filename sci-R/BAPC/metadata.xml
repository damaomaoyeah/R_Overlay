		Projection of cancer incidence and mortality data using Bayesian
		APC models fitted with INLA // Package implementing Bayesian
		age-period-cohort models with the focus on projections. BAPC
		uses integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) for full
		Bayesian inference.  BAPC generates age-specific and age-
		standardized projected rates. When interest lies in the
		predictive distribution, Poisson noise is automatically added.
		The INLA package can be obtained from http://www.r-inla.org .
		We recommend the testing version, which can be downloaded by
		running: install.packages("INLA",
		repos="http://www.math.ntnu.no/inla/R/testing").
