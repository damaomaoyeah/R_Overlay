		PARtial orders in Socio-EConomics // The package implements basic
		partial order tools for multidimensional poverty evaluation
		with ordinal variables. Its main goal is to provide socio-
		economic scholars with an integrated set of elementary
		functions for multidimensional poverty evaluation, based on
		ordinal information. The package is organized in four main
		parts. The first two comprise functions for data management and
		basic partial order analysis; the third and the fourth are
		devoted to evaluation and implement both the poset-based
		approach and a more classical counting procedure.
