		This packages provides an interface for a queue class along with
		providing a uni-process queue class. // A queue is a sequential
		data structure allowing users to push to the back of it to
		store data and pull from the front of it to retrieve data.  The
		queue data structure provided in this package is appropriate
		for use on a single-process R session.  However, there are
		other packages, such as redis.queue, that allow data structures
		to be passed between processes.
