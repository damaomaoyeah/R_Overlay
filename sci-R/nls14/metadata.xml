		Functions for nonlinear least squares solutions to replace nls(),
		nlmrt package and minpack.lm package. // nls14 provides tools
		for working with nonlinear least squares problems. It is
		intended to eventually supercede the nls() function in the R
		distribution. For example, nls() specifically does NOT deal
		with small or zero residual problems. Its Gauss-Newton method
		frequently stops with 'singular gradient' messages.
