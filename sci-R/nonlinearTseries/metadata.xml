		Nonlinear Time Series Analysis // Functions for nonlinear time
		series analysis. This package permits the estimation of the
		most-used nonlinear statistics/algorithms including generalized
		correlation dimension, information dimension, largest Lyapunov
		exponent, sample entropy and Recurrence Quantification Analysis
		(RQA), among others. Basic routines for surrogate data testing
		are also included. Part of this work was based on the  book
		"Nonlinear time series analysis" by Holger Kantz and Thomas
		Schreiber (ISBN: 9780521529020).
