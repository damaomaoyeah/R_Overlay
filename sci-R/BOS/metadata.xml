		Model-based clustering of multivariate ordinal data relying on a
		stochastic binary search algorithm // We design the first
		univariate probability distribution for ordinal data which
		strictly respects the ordinal nature of data. More precisely,
		it relies only on order comparisons between modalities.
		Contrariwise, most competitors either forget the order
		information or add a nonexistent distance information. The
		proposed distribution is obtained by modeling the data
		generating process which is assumed, from optimality arguments,
		to be a stochastic binary search algorithm in a sorted table.
		The resulting distribution is natively governed by two
		meaningful parameters (position and precision) and has very
		appealing properties: decrease around the mode, shape tuning
		from uniformity to a Dirac, identifiability. Moreover, it is
		easily estimated by an EM algorithm since the path in the
		stochastic binary search algorithm is missing. Using then the
		classical latent class assumption, the previous univariate
		ordinal model is straightforwardly extended to model-based
		clustering for multivariate ordinal data.
