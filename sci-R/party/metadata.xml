		A Laboratory for Recursive Partytioning // A computational
		toolbox for recursive partitioning. The core of the package is
		ctree(), an implementation of conditional inference trees which
		embed tree-structured regression models into a well defined
		theory of conditional inference procedures. This non-parametric
		class of regression trees is applicable to all kinds of
		regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric,
		censored as well as multivariate response variables and
		arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Based on
		conditional inference trees, cforest() provides an
		implementation of Breiman's random forests. The function mob()
		implements an algorithm for recursive partitioning based on
		parametric models (e.g. linear models, GLMs or survival
		regression) employing parameter instability tests for split
		selection. Extensible functionality for visualizing tree-
		structured regression models is available.
