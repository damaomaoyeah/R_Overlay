		SA Counterparty Credit Risk under Basel III // Computes the
		Exposure-At-Default based on standardized approach of the Basel
		III Regulatory framework (SA-CCR). Currently, trade types of
		all the five major asset classes have been created and, given
		the inheritance- based structure of the application, the
		addition of further trade types is straightforward. The
		application automatically separates the trades on the
		corresponding hedging and netting sets including the basis and
		volatility transactions. All the examples appearing on the
		regulatory paper (including the margined and the un-margined
		workflow) have been implemented.
