		Classifies RNA Structure Change in Chemical Mapping Data //
		Variations in RNA sequence lead to differences in RNA structure
		called riboSNitches, if important structural elements are
		disrupted. Recent ultra-high throughput techniques, such as
		SHAPE-MaP and PARS, enable the collection of structural
		information on RNAs at a genome-wide scale. With the ability to
		gather large amounts of structural information, it is important
		to accurately identify those structural changes that can
		potentially result in a phenotypic outcome. We have developed
		an automated approach to identify and classify structure change
		in chemical mapping data. This method utilizes random forest
		classification on a set of seven characterizing features. The
		default mutate and map SHAPE data sets (or another user
		specified data set) can be used to build a classifier. The
		classifier is then used to identify structure change in other
		SHAPE traces. Enabling scientists to identify structure change
		may help guide experiments that examine RNA structure and its
		role in biological processes.
