		Algorithms and framework for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
		(NMF) // This package provides a framework to perform Non-
		negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). It implements a set of
		already published algorithms and seeding methods, and provides
		a framework to test, develop and plug new/custom algorithms.
		Most of the built-in algorithms have been optimized in C++, and
		the main interface function provides an easy way of performing
		parallel computations on multicore machines.
