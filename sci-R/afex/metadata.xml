		Analysis of Factorial Experiments // Provides convenience
		functions for analyzing factorial experiments using ANOVA or
		mixed models. aov_ez(), aov_car(), and aov_4() allow convenient
		specification of between, within (i.e., repeated-measures), or
		mixed between-within (i.e., split-plot) ANOVAs for data in long
		format (i.e., one observation per row), potentially aggregating
		multiple observations per individual and cell of the design.
		mixed() fits mixed models using lme4::lmer() and computes
		p-values for all effects using either Kenward-Roger
		approximation for degrees of freedom (LMM only), parametric
		bootstrap (LMMs and GLMMs), or likelihood ratio tests (LMMs and
		GLMMs). afex uses type 3 sums of squares as default (imitating
		commercial statistical software).
