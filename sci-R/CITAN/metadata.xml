		CITation ANalysis toolpack // CITAN package for (among others)
		quantitative research in scientometrics and bibliometrics. It
		contains various tools for preprocessing bibliographic data
		retrieved e.g. from Elsevier's SciVerse Scopus and calculating
		bibliometric impact of individuals. Additionaly, some functions
		dealing with Pareto-Type II (GPD) and Discretized Pareto-Type
		II statistical models are included (e.g. Zhang-Stephens and MLE
		estimators, goodness-of-fit and two-sample tests, confidence
		intervals for the theoretical Hirsch index etc.). They may be
		used to describe and analyze many phenomena encountered in the
		social sciences.
