		Generic SQL helper functions for TSdbi SQL plugins // This
		package provides standard SQL query functions used by SQL
		plugins packages for the TSdbi interface to time series
		databases. It will mainly be used by other packages rather than
		directly by end users. The one exception is the function
		TSquery which can be used to construct a time series from a
		database containing observations over time (e.g. balance
		statements for muliple years), but where the database is not
		specifically designed to store time series (as with other TSdbi
		SQL plugin packages). Comprehensive examples of all the TS*
		packages is provided in the vignette Guide.pdf with the TSdata
		package.
