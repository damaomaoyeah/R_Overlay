		Analyses of Phylogenetics and Evolution // ape provides functions
		for reading, writing, plotting, and manipulating phylogenetic
		trees, analyses of comparative data in a phylogenetic
		framework, analyses of diversification and macroevolution,
		computing distances from allelic and nucleotide data, reading
		nucleotide sequences, and several tools such as Mantel's test,
		computation of minimum spanning tree, generalized skyline
		plots, estimation of absolute evolutionary rates and clock-like
		trees using mean path lengths, non-parametric rate smoothing
		and penalized likelihood. Phylogeny estimation can be done with
		the NJ, BIONJ, and ME methods.
