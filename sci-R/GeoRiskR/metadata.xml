		Data and functions for Geotechnical Risk Assessment // Data sets
		and functions for geotechnical reliability analysis. The
		GeoRiskR develops for geotechnical engineers to perform
		reliability analysis, in which several existing data sets (soil
		shear strengths, rock shear strengths, GCL shear strengths,
		soil texture, and the relation between initial void ratio and
		compression index) are compiled. The collected datasets are
		adopted from the existing literature, for instance,the data of
		shear strength parameters of soils composed by 509 paired
		parameters (including cohesion and inner friction angle)
		observed at 22 locations from 12 published papers.
