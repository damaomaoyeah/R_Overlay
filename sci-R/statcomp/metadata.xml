		Statistical Complexity and Information measures for time series
		analysis // An implementation of local and global statistical
		complexity measures for time series analysis in R. The package
		provides functions to compute statistical complexity and
		information measures for any given time series based on ordinal
		statistics (Bandt and Pompe 2002). The ordinal pattern
		statistics are used to calculate a variety of global
		(Permutation Entropy, MPR complexity) and local (Fisher
		Information) complexity and information measures (for further
		information, see Martin, Plastino and Rosso 2007; Olivares et
		al 2012). In addition, methods to derive weighted ordinal
		pattern distributions are supplied, where a user-specified
		weights-generating function can be selected (e.g. variance-
		weighted, Fadlallah et al 2013). Complexity and information
		measures constitute a simple, quick and powerful tool to
		classify and cluster (a large number of) time series, including
		for model-data comparisons.
