		Hierarchical Clustering Based on Log-Likelihood Ratio for Zero-
		Inflated Data // Algorithm to process hierarchical clustering
		on individuals (from a matrix individuals x variables). The
		dissimilarity used in the observation space is the log-
		likelihood ratio, i.e. D(i,j) = log f(Y_i) + log f(Y_j) - log
		f(Y_i U Y_j) where Y_i is the vector of observations from
		individual i. The statistical model defining the considered
		likelihood is standard Gaussian or Zero-Inflated Gaussian (i.e.
		a Gaussian-Bernoulli mixture). The agglomeration method is also
		the log-likelihood ratio, however between clusters in this
		case.
