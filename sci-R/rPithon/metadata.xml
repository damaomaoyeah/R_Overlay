		Use Python by Communicating Using a Pipe // rPithon is based on
		rPython (by Carlos J. Gil Bellosta), but instead of linking to
		the Python libraries, a Python program is started and is
		communicated with using a 'pipe'. This approach also allows
		multiple Python instances to be started, so that different R
		programs/packages can use different Python instances if
		desired.
