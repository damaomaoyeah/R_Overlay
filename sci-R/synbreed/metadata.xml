		Framework for the Analysis of Genomic Prediction Data using R //
		A collection of functions required for genomic prediction which
		were developed within the Synbreed project for synergistic
		plant and animal breeding (www.synbreed.tum.de). This covers
		data processing, data visualization, and analysis. All
		functions are embedded within the framework of a single,
		unified data object. The implementation is flexible with
		respect to a wide range of data formats in plant and animal
		breeding. This research was funded by the German Federal
		Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the
		AgroClustEr Synbreed - Synergistic plant and animal breeding
		(FKZ 0315528A).
