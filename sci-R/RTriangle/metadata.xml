		Triangle - A 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator
		// This is a port of Jonathan Shewchuk's Triangle library to R.
		From his description: "Triangle generates exact Delaunay
		triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming
		Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality
		triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or
		large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element
		analysis."
