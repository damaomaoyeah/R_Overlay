		The Skew Hyperbolic Student t-Distribution // Functions are
		provided for the density function, distribution function,
		quantiles and random number generation for the skew hyperbolic
		t-distribution. There are also functions that fit the
		distribution to data. There are functions for the mean,
		variance, skewness, kurtosis and mode of a given distribution
		and to calculate moments of any order about any centre. To
		assess goodness of fit, there are functions to generate a Q-Q
		plot, a P-P plot and a tail plot.
