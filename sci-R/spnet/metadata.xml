		Plotting (social) networks on maps // Facilitates the rendering
		of networks for which nodes have a specific position on a map
		(cities, participants in a political debate, etc.). Map data
		and network data are stored together in a single object which
		handles the match between network nodes and their respective
		position on the map. The plot method renders both the map and
		the network data. Several networks can be plot simultaneously.
		The graphic is highly customizable and the legend is
		automatically printed. Map data have to be supplied as
		SpatialPolygons objects (from the sp package) and network data
		as named matrix.
