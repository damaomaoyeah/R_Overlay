		Chemical Thermodynamics and Activity Diagrams // Functions and
		data sets to support chemical thermodynamic modeling in
		biochemistry and low-temperature geochemistry. The features
		include calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic
		properties and chemical affinities of reactions involving
		minerals and/or biomolecules; a database of thermodynamic
		properties of aqueous, crystalline and gaseous species; amino
		acid group additivity for the standard molal thermodynamic
		properties of neutral and ionized proteins; use of the revised
		Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations of state for aqueous
		species; construction of equilibrium activity diagrams as a
		function of temperature, pressure, and chemical activities or
		fugacities of basis species.
