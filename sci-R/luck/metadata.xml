		Generalized iLUCK models // Generalized iLUCK-models are a way to
		define sets of priors based on conjugate priors, with the
		property that the set of posteriors, obtained by updating each
		prior in the set by Bayes' rule, is still easy to handle.
		Generalized iLUCK-models belong to the domain of imprecise
		probability (or interval probability models), allow to include
		non-stochastic uncertainty ('ambiguity') in Bayesian analysis,
		and lead to reasonable inferences in case of prior-data
		conflict.
