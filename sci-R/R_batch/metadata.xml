		Methods to run batch jobs in R // The package provides methods to
		batch run R scripts in a straightforward manner. A job batch is
		defined by a root directory containing subdirectories todo/,
		running/, finished/, failed/, src/ among others. A job to be
		processed is a directory placed in todo/. A job is processed by
		moving it to running/, then sourcing the R files in src/
		(containing common code) and then the ones in the job directory
		(contain job specific code), in which a function onRun() has to
		be defined, which is then called. Succesfully jobs end up in
		finished/ whereas failed jobs in failed/.
