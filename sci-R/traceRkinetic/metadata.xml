		Kinetic analysis for dynamic nuclear imaging: compartmental
		models // This package implements compartmental models and
		linear approximations needed to perform kinetic analysis on
		dynamic medical images. The provided functions use the tissue
		time-activity curves, the input function and the frame times as
		input, and return the kinetic parameters and the estimated
		errors.
