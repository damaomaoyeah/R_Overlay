		A procedure for large scale contamination search // A fast
		contamination search algorithm to search between trace samples
		(mixtures) and between trace samples and reference samples
		where the trace samples are selected within a range of time.
		The match statistic uses likelihood ratio (LR) calculation
		based on allele frequencies to create decreasing sorted table
		of the most likely matches. The user can select threshold for
		LR to assign matches and change the model to take into account
		drop-in/out.
