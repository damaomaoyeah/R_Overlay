		Simulation of Survival Studies with Microarray Data // The main
		part of this package is the simulation of a survival study
		based on simulated gene expression level data and simulated
		patient data. Functions to generate such gene expression level
		data and patient data are included as well.  Resulting error
		rate (FDR) and power rate can be visualized.  Thus, this
		package can be used for sample size or power estimations in the
		planning of a study.
