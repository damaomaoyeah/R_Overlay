		General Linear Ballistic Accumulator Models // Analyses response
		times and accuracies from psychological experiments with the
		linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model from Brown and
		Heathcote (2008). The LBA model is optionally fitted with
		explanatory variables on the parameters such as the drift rate,
		the boundary and the starting point parameters. A log-link
		function on the linear predictors can be used to ensure that
		parameters remain positive when needed.
