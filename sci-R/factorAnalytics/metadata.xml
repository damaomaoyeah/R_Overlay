		Factor Analytics // An R package for the estimation and risk
		analysis of linear factor models for asset returns and
		portfolios. It contains model fitting methods for the three
		major types of factor models: time series (or, macroeconomic)
		factor model, fundamental factor model and statistical factor
		model. They allow for different types of distributions to be
		specified for modeling the fat-tailed behavior of financial
		returns, including Edgeworth expansions. Risk analysis measures
		such as VaR and ES, as well as performance attribution for
		factor models (factor-contributed vs idiosyncratic returns) are
		included.
