		Simple tools for creating KML displays from R // This is a
		collection of some general and quite simple facilities for
		creating KML content to display in Google Earth from R. This
		provides a formula mechanism for identifying longitude and
		latitude, time and groups. The intent of the package is to
		illustrate how we can programmatically generate KML content
		from within R. There are many more things we can do including
		placing plots generated in R in KML displays. This is more a
		"proof of concept" and a start for others to build upon.
