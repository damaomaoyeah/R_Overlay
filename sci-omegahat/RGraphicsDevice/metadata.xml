		A framework for developing R graphics devices entirely in R //
		This package provides a framework that allows one to program an
		R graphics device entirely within R, i.e. using R functions.
		The motivation is to allow rapid prototyping of graphics
		devices for new formats/targets to be done by those not as
		familiar with the C--evel details of R graphics devices.  An
		example is a Flash graphics device, i.e. that creates graphical
		output as Flex/ActionScript code. Another is a device that
		generates JavaScript code that renders on a JavaScript canvas
		(see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial). We can
		then annotate the output from such devices to make them
		interactive. See the SVGAnnotation package for an example.
