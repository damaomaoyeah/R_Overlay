		Interface to the clang parser's C API // This package is
		currently an interface to some of the functionality in the
		clang parsing facilities. The idea is to be able to extract
		information from C and C++ source files and headers so that we
		can do semantic analysis on the contents and use this
		information in various different ways. One application is to be
		able to programmatically generate bindings to arbitrary C/C++
		routines.  The functionality here is similar to the basic
		facilities in RGCCTranslationUnit. We will probably develop a
		richer and more powerful interface using the C++ API that will
		give us access to all of the AST classes.
