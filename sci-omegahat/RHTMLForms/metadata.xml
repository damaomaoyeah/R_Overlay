		Programmatically create R functions corresponding to Web/HTML
		forms. // This package provides tools to process HTML forms and
		create R functions that can mimic a browser's interaction with
		the form. This allows S users to progammatically access data
		that is available via an HTML form, avoiding the manual
		interaction and the need to manage the data from the browser to
		R via files.  Instead, the data from the form processing is
		immediately available in R. This does not currently deal with
		dynamic forms, and basically does not handle JavaScript in a
		form.
