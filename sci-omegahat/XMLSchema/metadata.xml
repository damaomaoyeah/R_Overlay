		R facilities to read XML schema // A package that reads XML
		schema into an R representation and can perform some operations
		on the resulting information to generate class definitions and
		code to read documents using this schema. This is code that was
		originally in the SSOAP package for reading WSDL files that
		describe Web Services and use XML schema.
