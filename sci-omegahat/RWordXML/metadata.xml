		Simple tools for Open Office Word Processing XML documents //
		This is a collection of some general and quite simple
		facilities accessing common elements from within R of an Open
		XML Word Procesing document, Microsoft's current format. These
		provide examples for accessing the contents of the document and
		its meta-data. More will be added for modifying the content,
		and also reading richer structures. At present, this is more an
		illustration of what is possible and a way to encourage others
		to explore these documents.  We can do very similar things for
		OpenOffice documents. (See ROpenOffice for a start.)
