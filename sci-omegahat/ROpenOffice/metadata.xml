		Basic reading of Open Office spreadsheets and workbooks // This
		is a simple start to reading workbooks and spreadsheets from
		Open Office documents.  Sometime we will incorporate the ideas
		from the RExcelXML package to be able to read and write
		workbooks and worksheets and subset the sheets symbolically.
		The reading of the spread sheets appears to work on simple
		examples, but may not be necessarily robust.  Examples of where
		it fails are appreciated.
