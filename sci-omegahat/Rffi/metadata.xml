		Interface to libffi to dynamically invoke arbitrary compiled
		routines at run-time without compiled bindings // This package
		allows one to use libffi to invoke compiled routines that are
		dynamically loaded into R but for which there are no explicitly
		compiled bindings. This package is both an interface to
		functionality in the libffi library, and also an additional
		layer of  R classes and functionality for run-time interaction
		with native/compiled code. Byron Ellis did some work on this
		several years ago.
