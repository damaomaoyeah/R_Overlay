		Tools for working with Excel XML documents // This is a
		collection of some general and quite simple facilities for
		working with Excel spreadsheets and workbooks. The ideas and
		some of the code should generalize to OpenOffice and other
		spreadsheets. At present this is intended as a relatively
		shallow implementation, and is aimed at providing a foundation
		to illustrate how one uses the XML and other packages to work
		with these types of documents. The hope is for others to
		contribute additional functionality or even take ownership of
		the package and extend it. We have developed functionality
		similar to this for Word and Excel using DCOM and the
		RDCOMClient facilities.
