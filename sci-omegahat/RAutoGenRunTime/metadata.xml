		Run-time support for automated interfaces to R // The package
		provides classes, methods, functions and compiled C code used
		by automatically generated interfaces from R to C/C++ code
		using the RGCCTranslationUnit from the omegahat.org project.
		Many of the functions can also be used in other
		dynamic/programmatic interfaces, e.g. Rffi and RGCCTUFFI., and
		generally when interacting with native code. These functions
		are separate from the RGCCTranslationUnit package as that is
		used to programmatically generate the binding/wrapper code.
		This can be done once without actually invoking any of the
		native routines in a target native library. This package,
		however, is used at run-time. So we don't need the
		RGCCTranslationUnit package at that moment in time, but do need
		the functions that programmatically code refers to.
