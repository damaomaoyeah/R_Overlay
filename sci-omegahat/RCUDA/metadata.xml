		R bindings for CUDA library for GPU computing // This package
		provides initial bindings to the CUDA library for working with
		GPUs. It is similar to Simon Urbanek's OpenCL package. The idea
		is to be able execute code on the GPU from within R. This
		offers a high-level programming interface to use GPUs within R.
		It will also offer a full set of bindings to the CUDA SDK so
		that others can experiment with different features of the SDK
		such as pinned memory, streams, events, and explore how to
		leverage these for greater performance. We have longer term
		goals which will allow us to compile (simple) R code into GPU
		kernels and also compile code that refers to the CUDA routines
		that work on the host.  This is similar to libNVVM.
