		R interface to GCC source code information // This package
		provides rich facilities for extracting meta-data about C/C++
		code to get a description of variables, routines, data
		structures, classes and methods. We use these to
		programmatically explore and summarize native code and
		importantly, to generate R bindings to it (or for other
		languages). This differs from SWIG in that a) it makes the
		information available to R programmers directly and so the
		analysis of the code and binding generation can be done
		entirely within R, and b) it provides more information than
		SWIG does, e.g. allowing us to examine the bodies of
		routines/methods and so compute call graphs, analyze the use of
		global variables. This holds some promise for helping to
		automate the conversion of C code in R packages to thread-safe
		code for use with in-process concurrent threads, and general
		refactoring.
