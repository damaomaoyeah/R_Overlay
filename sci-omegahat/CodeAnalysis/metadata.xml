		Tools for static analysis of R code // This package provides a
		(growing) collection of functions that analyze R code and
		identify particular idioms or characteristics. Some of these
		functions modify the code to produce more streamlined version.
		The package is motivated by compilation of R code and
		simplifying code ahead of compilation. However, the
		functionality may be useful generally for improving R code and
		diagnosing issues, and also in other contexts such as dynamic
		documents. We will continue to add functionality to analyze
		code for different purposes, e.g. memory management,
		opportunities for parallelism, data locality for parallel
		computations, ... Currently, there is functionality to *  find
		unused parameters/arguments *  find unused
		variables/assignments *  identify constant parameters (i.e.
		unchanged in the function's body) *  detect vector
		concatenation in loops *  identify  remove dead code (after a
		call to return()) *  remove dead if/else code blocks (i.e.
		where we are certain the condition is TRUE or FALSE)
