		Interface to Snowball implementation of Porter's word stemming
		algorithm. // An R interface to the C code that implements
		Porter's word stemming algorithm for collapsing words to a
		common root to aid comparison of texts.  There is code to for
		different languages (i.e. danish, dutch, english, finnish,
		french, german, norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish,
		swedish). However, these may not be applicable if the words
		require UTF encoding. This is extensible by allowing different
		routines to be specified to create the C routines used in the
		stemming, permitting debugging, profiling, pool management,
		caching, etc.
