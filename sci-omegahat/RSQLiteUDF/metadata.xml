		Ability to register R functions and C routines as SQLite
		functions // This provides a mechanism for users to be able to
		register R functions and C routines as functions that can be
		used in SQL queries within SQLite.   This can be convenient so
		that we can, e.g., filter records directly in the database
		without having to bring them back to R and then filter them
		out. This is very similar to what I did with Postgres and MySQL
		in 2000 to allow R functions be used as UDFs when embedded
		within the DBMS engine. Here, of course, SQLite is embedded in
		R. Ultimately, we want to be able to compile R functions to
		native code and register these.
