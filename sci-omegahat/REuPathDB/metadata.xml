		Interface to REST API of (EuPathDB) // This package provides an
		interface to the Web Services of Eukaryotic Pathogen Database
		Resources (EuPathDB). The code is mostly programmatically
		generated by reading the WADL files describing the different
		methods and resources. Version 1.0-0 differs from the first
		version by collapsing the XML and JSON versions of each method
		into a single function and allows the caller to specify which
		version to use. The JSON version is the default for each
		method. The code is created by the generate2.R script in this
		directory and version 0.2-0 or higher of the WADL package.
