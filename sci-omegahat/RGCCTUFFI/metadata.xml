		Programmatically generate interfaces to C routines and data
		structures that are accessed dynamically via Rffi // This
		package allows us to programmatically read C code to get
		descriptions of routines and data types and then generate R
		code and class definitions that  allow us to invoke those
		routines and access the contents of the native data structures
		all using R code and Rffi. So there is no need to explicitly
		compile C code for each routine or data structure.
