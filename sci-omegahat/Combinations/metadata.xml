		Compute the combinations of choosing r items from n elements. //
		Generates the combinations for choosing r items from a set of n
		items. When n gets large, the package provides a mechanism for
		dealing with each combination as it is generated so that one
		does not have to hold the entire collection around and operate
		on them after creating the entire collection. This makes
		computations feasible for very large numbers of combinations.
		It does not necessarily make them fast! The package is also a
		good example of the basics of calling R functions from C code.
		It also illustrates aspects of adapting code for a stand-alone
		application to be used within an interactive language like
		R/S-Plus, Python, Perl or Matlab/Octave.
