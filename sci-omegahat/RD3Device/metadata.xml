		R Graphics device to create D3 content // This is an experiment
		to create a graphics device for R that creates D3 code for
		displaying the  R plot in JavaScript. As we go forward, we can
		programmatically annotate the content of the plot to create
		interactive, dynamic plots with animation. This is similar to
		gridSVG, SVGAnnotation, etc. It is not intended to allow R
		users to create arbitrary D3 code. It is solely focused on
		mapping existing R plotting commands using R's graphics
		system(s) to D3 code. Given the RGraphicsDevice package, this
		is very easy to write entirely within R. It takes longer to
		understand the D3 programming details than to implement the
		graphics device's methods.
