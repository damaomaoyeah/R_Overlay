		Create virtual tables from R Objects that can be Used Directly in
		an SQLite database // This is a mechanism to explore using
		virtual tables in SQLite from within R and providing the
		contents of an SQLite table via R objects, specifically, an R
		data frame. At its very simplest, this is a means of not having
		to explicitly import the data frame into SQLite (via INSERT
		commands or dumping it as a CSV file and then .import).
		Instead, we can take the data frame in memory in R and expose
		it as a table via an abstract interface that does not require
		an immediate copy of the data from R. This package aims to
		facilitate exploring the ideas. We can experiment with
		different indexing strategies, etc.
