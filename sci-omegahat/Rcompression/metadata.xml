		In-memory decompression for GNU zip and bzip2 formats. // The
		package is a basic interface to some of the compression
		facilities in the zlib and bzip2 libraries for uncompressing
		(and compressing) data in memory that is not in a file. It
		handles bz2, gzip and regular compress (.Z) content.  It can
		work on files or with data in memory, e.g. downloaded directly
		into memory via an HTTP request.  It is used when we don't want
		to write data to a file and then read it back into R. This is
		common when performing HTTP requests via the RCurl package and
		dependent packages such as SSOAP.
