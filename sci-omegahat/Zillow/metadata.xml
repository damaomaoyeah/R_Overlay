		Simple interface to Zillow.com's house price estimate API // This
		package provides relatively simple facilities for querying
		Zillow.com for information about estimated house prices for a
		property. It allows one to get information about a particular
		property and also about up to 30 "comparable" properties. The
		information includes price estimate, range for the estimate,
		tax assessment and year, zip code, lot and finished square
		feet, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, date and price last
		sold. All of this is made available by Zillow. This package is
		merely an illustration of how this information can be retrieved
		in R via Web services using the XML and RCurl packages. To use
		this, you will need to have a Zillow account and Zillow Web
		Services Id (ZWSID).
