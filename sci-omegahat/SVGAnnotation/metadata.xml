		Tools for post-processing SVG plots created in R // This package
		is an example of how we can post-process SVG files generated
		with R graphics, at present just those generated via the svg()
		function within R itself using the cairo library. (Support for
		RSVGDevice may be added in the future.) The idea is that we can
		add "effects" to the SVG components such as putting tooltips on
		the elements (points, bars, etc.) in the plot, animating points
		over "time" within one or more plots, changing colors of
		symbols within plots for simple linking. The package provides
		high-level facilities for annotating the plots, and also low-
		level facilities for finding plot regions, lattice panels and
		strips, determining coordinates of regions and so on. Others
		can use these to provide additional annotation functionality.
		This also provides facilities for adding a reference to a CSS
		file so that the appearance of certain types of elements can be
		controlled externally, e.g. links. This package contains
		JavaScript code for inteactive GUI components rendered via SVG.
		This is code written by Andreas Neumann and Andreas Winter and
		obtained from http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/gui. This differs
		from Tony Plate's RSVGTipsDevice as a) it uses the SVG device
		within R based on libcairo, and b) it does not use global
		variables and require tooltips and hyperrefs to be specified
		one at a time and before drawing each individual shape.
		Instead, this approach allows us deal with all elements of an R
		plot and add SVG features to each of them. This package was put
		together as a proof of concept and example of how to go about
		doing this sort of post-processing to enhance R plots to make
		them interactive and dynamic/animated. More can be done and
		what has been done can be done better. Others are encouraged to
		submit enhancements, changes, etc.
