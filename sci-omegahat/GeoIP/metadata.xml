		Mapping IP addresses to physical locations // This package allows
		one to map a computer's IP address to a country, and with the
		appropriate (free) database, obtain the longitude and latitude,
		city name, phone code for the area, etc. This is done by
		interfacing to the MaxMinds GeoIP database via their C API. The
		code for this package is autogenerated using
		RGCCTranslationUnit and the run-time bindings provided by the
		Rffi package.
